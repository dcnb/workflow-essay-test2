which in the *Leaf* offers it self next to
be observed, is its *Figure*. This is infinitely varied
with the several Kinds of *Plants*: and there
are some, which have *Leaves* (besides the two
first *Dissimilar* ones) of Two Kinds or Two distinct
*Figures*; as the *Bitter-Sweet*, the common
*Little Bell*, *Valerian*, *Lady-Smocks*, and
others. For the *Under Leaves* of *Bitter-Sweet*,
are Entire; the Upper, with two *Lobes*: the Under *Leaves* of the
*Little Bell*, like those of *Pancy*; the Upper, like those of *Carnation*,
or of *Sweet-William*. And in some *Plants*, Nature affecteth a Kind
of *Irregularity*; the *Leaves* whereof are of no one certain *Figure*; as
in *Dragon*, *Peony*, *Bishops-Weed*, &c.

2. §. BUT the *Leaves* of most *Plants*, have a Regular *Figure*;
and this Regularity, both in Length and Circuit, always defineable.
In *Length*; by the Proportion between the several *Leaves* upon one
*Stalk*, *Tab. 46.* or between the several *Lobes* upon one *Leaf*. So the *Leaves*
of *Clematis Sylv. major*, which stand by Ternaries, shorten by equal
*Proportions*, that is to say, if, the chief *Fiber* of each, be divided into
equal *Parts*; their several Lengths are not as Ten, Eight, and Four; but
as Ten, Eight, and Six. So the *Lobes* and *Fibers* of *Clematis Virginiana
Hederæ folio*, of *Artenuisa*, &c. shorten in like manner by equal
Proportions. The same is observable in measuring, upon a *Gooseberry-Leaf*,
*Tab. 46.* from the Poynt of the first *Lobe*, to the first *Angle*; from thence,
to the second Poynt; from thence, to the second Angle; and from
thence to the third Poynt.

3. §. But in many, the Proportion is different. So in the *Leaves*
of the *Lesser Maple*; the shortning of the *smaller Lobes*, with respect to
the middlemost; is not Equal, but Double to that of the middlemost,
with respect to the Greater. For if their chief *Fibres* be divided into
Equal Parts, they are as Eleven, Nine, and Five. On the contrary,
in the *Leaves* of *Althæa fruticosa Pentaphylloidea*, the middlemost *Lobes*
shorten by a greater Proportion than the Least; all three being as Ten,
Fourteen, and Twenty.

4. §. WITH respect to the *Circumference*, the *Figure* of most
*Leaves* is very Complex. Yet Two things are evident. First, that all
Regular *Leaves*, are defined or measured out by *Circles*; that is, by the
*Arches* or *Segments* of several *Circles*, having either the same, or divers
*Centers* and *Diameters*. Secondly, That the Length of the *Leaf*,
or of the chief *Fiber* thereof, is the *Standard Measure* for the *Diameters*
of these *Circles*: these being either its full Length, or certain
equal parts substracted, or multiplied; as half its Length, or its Length
and half, &c.

5. §. TO make this appear, I shall give several Instances: of some,
where both the Edges are of one Measure; and of others, where they
are different. And of both kinds, where they are measured by fewer,
and where by more *Circles*.

6. §. The *Leaf* of *Lagopus major fol. pennat.* is measured by One
*Circle*, the same on both Edges, whose *Diametre* is Thrice the Length
of the *Leaf*.

7. §. That of *Syderitis Salviæ fol.* by Two *Circles*: the *Diameter*
of the Lower, being Twice the Length of the *Leaf*; *Tab. 44.* of the upper,
the Length and half. In both these the *Circles* are drawn Outward;
that is, with their Centers some where upon the middlemost or chief
*Fiber* of the *Leaf*.

8. §. That of *Orange-Tree*, is also measured by Two *Circles*: but
one of them repeated with *Opposite Centers*. That next the *Cone* of
the *Leaf*, is drawn Inward; that is, with the *Center* no where upon the
*Leaf*, but without it. The *Diameter* hereof is just the Length of the
*Leaf*. *Tab. 44.* The midle part of the Edge is measured by the same *Circle*,
only drawn Outward. The lower *Circle* next the *Stalk*, is drawn Inward,
as the upper; and its *Diameter* Three times the Length of the
*Leaf*.

9. §. The *Leaf* of the *Venetian Vetch*, is measured by Three *Circles*.
That next the *Cone*, drawn Inward; the *Diameter* whereof is
Twice the Length of the *Leaf*; the next is drawn Outward; *Tab. 44.* whereof
the *Diameter*, is just the Length. The third or lowermost, is drawn
also Outward; and its *Diameter*, half the Length. So that they all
lessen by an Equal Proportion.

10. §. The *Leaf* of *Great Laserwort*, is also measured by
Three *Circles*; all drawn Outward, and one of them Repeated. The
*Diameter* of that next the *Cone*, is Half the Length of the *Leaf*; *Tab. 45.* of the
next, Thrice the Length; of the Third, just the Length; the lowermost,
is the same with the First.

11. §. That of *Broad Leav’d Laserwort*, is also measured with Three
*Circles*; and one of them repeated with *Opposite Centers*. The *Diameter*
of the First, is Half the Length of the *Leaf*; *Tab. 44.* of the Second, Twice
the Length; of the Third, just the Length: all of them drawn Outward.
That next the *Stalk*, is the same with the First; only drawn
Inward.

12. §. The *Figure* of the *Leaf* of the *Cornelian Cherry*, is exactly that
of the foregoing, Inverted: the same measure there beginning at the
*Base*, *Tab. 44.* and ending at the *Cone*; which here begins at the *Cone*, and ends
at the *Base*: as by comparing their Draughts together may be observ’d.

13. §. IN ALL, the foregoing Examples, both the Edges of the
*Leaves* have the same *Measure*. But they have oftentimes, different
ones; as in these that follow.

14. § The *Leaf* of *Althæa fruticosa*, is measured by Three *Circles*. The
left Edge (as the *Leaf* lies with the backside upward) by One *Circle*,
but Twice repeated. For the *Diameter* of the First, is the Length of
the *Leaf*; *Tab. 45.* the Second is the same, but drawn upon another Center;
the Third also the same, but drawn Inward. The right Edg, is measur’d
by Two *Circles*: the *Diameter* of the First, being the Length of
the *Leaf*; of the Second, Half the Length.

15. §. That of *Black Poplar*, by Three; and each Edge by Three
repeated. On the left, the *Diameter* of the First, is the Length of the
*Leaf*; *Tab. 45.* of the Second, Half the length; of the Third, the Length and
Half. The *Measure* of the right Edge, is that of the left, Inverted:
the same *Measure* there beginning at the *Base*, and ending at the *Cone*;
which here begins at the *Cone*, and ends at the *Base*.

16. §. That of *Doronicum*, is measured by Three *Circles*, whereof,
one is repeated Once; and another Thrice. The right Edge by Two,
and One repeated. For the *Diameter* of the First or that next the *Cone*;
is the Length of the *Leaf*; the next is the same, but drawn Outward;
the *Diameter* of the Third, is Half the Length. The left Edge, by
Three *Circles*; *Tab. 45.* whereof One is repeated on the same Edge, and Two,
the same, as on the other. For the *Diameter* of the first, is the Length
of the *Leaf*; of the Second, Four times the Length; the Third, the
same as the First; and of the Fourth, Half the Length.

17. §. Lastly, that of *Mountain Calamint* is measured by Four
*Circles*. *Tab. 45.* The left Edge, by Three *Circles*, of which, the lowermost is
once repeated: the right Edge also by Two; whereof the nether is
likewise once repeated.

18. §. It may seem, even from these Instances, no very unobvious
Conclusion; That all *Crooked Lines*, *Spiral*, *Helick*, *Elliptick*, *Hyperbolick*,
*Regular*, or *Irregular*; are made up of the *Arches* of *Circles*, having
either the same, or divers *Centers* and *Diameters*. And, as otherwise
so from the *Contemplation* of *Plants*, men might first be invited to *Mathematical*
Enquirys.

19. §. TOGETHER with the *Figure* of the *Leaf*, the *Position*
of the *Fibers*, as it is apparent before Dissection, is observable; especially
on the back of the *Leaf*. Whereof I shall add, to what I have
said in the *First* **Book**, the following *Remarques*.

20. §. First, that there are some *Leaves*, in which the first Collateral
*Fibres* make *Right Angles* with the Great one in the midle: as
the *Great-Maple*, the *Great Celandine*, *Chondrilla*, and the rest, or many,
of the *Intybous* Kind; with some few others. But that generally all the
chief *Fibers* of a *Leaf*, make *Acute Angles* together: both where they
stand collateral with the midle *Fiber*, as in *Strawberry*; and where they
all part at the *Stalk*, as in *Mallow*.

21. §. Again, that of these, there are some few, any two of whose
Defining *Fibres* making two *Rays* of equal Length, take in One Eighth
Part of a *Circle*, *Tab. 46, & 47.* as in *Mallow*, and in some one Tenth: but in most
they take in either one Twelfth part, as in *Holy-Oak*; or one Sixth, as
in *Sirynga*. So that where the *Fibres* stand Collateral with one in the
midle, if you suppose them to be drawn out at *Opposite Angles*;
or where the chief *Fibers* part at the *Stalk*, you only take in the *Stalk*;
you will thereby divide a *Circle* into Eight, Twelve, or Six equal Parts;
as in *Sirynga*, the *Vine* and others. And so likewise, where there are
several *Sprigs* upon one *Stem*, *Tab. 46, 47.* as in *Fenil*, *Hemlock*, and the like:
as will best be understood by the *Figures*.
