### CHAP. III.

### Of the COLOURS of Plants produced by their Mixture
    with other Bodies.

HE
 last general Enquiry proposed to be made,
was this, After what manner they would exhibite
themselves upon the *Mixture* of those *Infusions*,
or of any one of them with some other
*Liquor*.

2. §. A strong *Infusion*, or the *Juyce* of the
*Leavs* of *Rose-Tree*, *Raspis*, *Strawberry*, *Cynquefoyle*,
*Goosberry*, *Primrose*, *Jerusalem Cowslip*,
*Bears-eare*, *Bearsfoot*, *Peony*, *Bistort*, *Lawrel*,
*Goats-beard*, droped upon *Steel*, make a *Purple Tincture*. But that of
*Vine Leaves* scarce maketh any *Tincture* at all. So that there is something
else besides *Sowerness* concurring to the *Purple* upon *Steel*.

3. §. *Saccharum Saturni* droped on a *Tincture* of *Red Roses*, turneth
it to a *faint pale Green*.

4. §. *Salt* of *Tartar* droped upon the same *Tincture*, turneth it to
a *deeper Green*.

5. §. *Spirit* of *Harts Horn* droped upon a *Tincture* of the *Flower*
of *Lark-heel* and *Borage* turn them to a *verdegreese Green*.

6. §. *Spirit* of *Harts Horn* droped on most *green Leavs* doth not
change them at all. The like Effects have *Aq. Calcis*, and *Spirit* of
*S. Armoniac*.

7. §. These *Experiments* seem to confirm, That it is some *Alkaline*
or other like *Salt* in the *Aer*, which is *predominant* in the production
of *Green* in the *Leavs* of *Plants*.

8. §. *Salt* of *Tartar* droped on the *white Flowers* of *Daisy*, changeth
them into a *light Green*. Which as it further confirms the aforesaid
*Position*; so likewise argues, That *Whiteness* in *Flowers*, is not always
from the defect of *Tincture*: but that there may be *White*, as well as
*Yellow*, *Green*, *Red* or *Blew Tinctures*.

9. §. *Spirit* of *Sulphur* droped on the *green Leavs* of *Adonis Flower*,
*Everlasting Pease*, and *Holy Oak*, turns them all *Yellow*.

10. §. *Spirit* of *Sulphur* on a *Tincture* of *Saffron* changeth it not.

11. §. *Spirit* of *Sulphur* on the *Yellow Flower* of *Crowfoot* alters
them not. Neither are they changed by the *Affusion* of *Alkalies*.

12. §. So that it seemeth, that in all *Yellows*, the *Sulphureous Acid*
and *Alkaline Parts* are all more equal.

13. §. *Spirit* of *Sulphur* on a *Tincture* of *Violets* turns it from *Blew*
to a true *Lacke*, or midle *Crimson*.

14. §. *Spirit* of *Sulphur* upon a *Tincture* of *Clove-July-Flowers* makes
a bright blood *Red*. Into the like *Colour*, it hightens a *Tincture* of *Red
Roses*.

15. §. So that as *Alkalys*, or other *Analogous Salts*, are *predominant*
in *Greens*, so *Acids* in *Reds*, especially in the brighter *Reds*, in
the *Leavs* and *Flowers* of *Plants*. Hence it is, that *Spirit* of *Nitre*
droped upon the *Blew Flower* of *Ladies Looking-Glass*, *Larkspur*, *Borage*,
turns them all *Red*, *sc.* into the *Red* of *Common Lychnis*. But
(which is particularly to be noted) being droped on the said *Red
Flowers* of *Lychnis*, alters them little or nothing: because, that very
*Colour* is therein produced by a copious admixture of the like *Principle*.

16. §. The Summ therefore of what hath now been said, of the
*Causes* of *Vegetable Colours*, is this: That while their *Sulphur* and *Saline
Principles*, only swim together, and are not as yet united into one *Precipitate*,
no *Colour* results from them, but the *Contents* are rather
*Limpid*; as usually in the *Root*, and many other *Parenchymous
Parts*.

17. §. When they are united, and the *Alkaline* are *predominant*,
they produce a *Green*.

18. §. When the *Sulphur* and the *Alkaline* are more equal, they
produce a *Tauny*.

19. §. When the *Sulphur*, *Acid* and *Alkaline*, there a *Yellow*.

20. §. When the *Sulphur predominant*, and the *Acid* and *Alkaline*
equal, there a *Blew*.

21. §. When the *Sulphur* and *Acid* are *predominant* to the *Alkaline*,
then a *Purple*.

22. §. When the *Sulphur predominant* to the *Alkaline* and the *Acid*
to them both, a *Scarlet*.

23. §. *Lastly*, When the *Acid predominant* to the *Alkaline*, and the
*Sulphur* to them both, a *Blood-Red*: which is the highest and most
*Sulphurious Colour* in Nature.

24. §. From the *Premises*, divers Rules do also result for the making
of *Tinctures*, either for *Medicines*, or for any other purposes.

25. §. I shall only add one or two Notes. As first, that of all
*Colours*, *Yellows* are the most fixed and unfading. As for instance, if
you drop either a *Solution* of *Tartar*, or of *Spirit* of *Sulphur* upon a
*Tincture* of the *Yellow Flowers* of *Crowfoot*, of *Adonis*, or of *Saffron*,
neither of them will alter their *Colour*. Which shewes the strength
of most *Yellows*, to resist all manner of impressions from the *Aer*.

26. §. Again, that the use of *Salts*, is not only to highten or
deepen *Colours*, but also to fix and make them permanent. As for Instance,
The *Tincture* of *Clove-July-Flowers*, made either with *Water*
or *Spirit* of *Wine* being exposed to the *Aer*, will often turn into a
*Blackish Purple*. But the addition of a few drops of *Spirit* of *Sulphur*,
doth not only highten the *Colour*, but renders it stable and permanent.

27. §. Likewise, of *Salts* themselves there is choice to be made.
For there are some, which although they fix the *Colour*, yet, will a
little *give*, as we say, and not hold throughly dry; as most *Lixivial
Salts*, and *Stillatious Acids*. But there are some *Salts*, which will
not *give* in the least, as *Alum*, that in *Lime-Water* and some others;
which latter, is so far from being moystened, that it is rather petrified
by the *Aer*. For which reason I take it to be one of the best *Liquors*
for a stable and permanent *Green*, and some other *Colours*.

28. §. Amongst all *Water-Colours*, the rarest, and most difficult
to make clear bright and permanent, is a *Blew*. There are many *Flowers*
of an excellent *Blew*, as those of *Bugloss*, *Lark-heel* and others; but
they easily fade. And there are very few *Flowers* that will strike into
a *Blew* by any *Liquor*; being almost all changeable into *Green*,
*Purple* or *Red*. Yet some few there are, in which this *Colour* may be
produced. As for instance, the *Flower* of *Lathyrus* or *Parseverlasting*;
which upon the affusion of *Spirit* of *Harts-Horn* is changed from a
*Peach*, to as pure a *Blew*, as the best *Ultramarine*: that which hitherto
is, I think, wanting in *Water Colours*. *Spirit* of *Harts Horn* was the
*Liquor* I used; but I question not, but that other *Alkalies*, and particularly
*Lime-Water*, will have the like Effect, and so render it the
more stable.

29. §. From what hath been said, we may likewise be confirmed
in the use of the already known *Rules*, and directed unto others yet
unknown, in order to the variation of the *Colours* of *Flowers* in their
Growth. The effecting of this, by putting the *Colour* desired in the
*Flower*, into the *Body* or *Root* of the *Plant*, is vainly talked of by
some: being such a piece of cunning, as for the obtaining a painted
face, to eat good store of *white* and *Red Lead*.

30. §. The best known *Rules* are these Two; First, that the
*Seed* be used above any other part, if the variation of the *Colour* be intended.
One reason whereof is, because that part being but very small,
the *Tinctures* of the *Soyl* will have the greater over proportion to those
of the *Seed*. Besides, the tender and *Virgin Seed*, being committed to
the Soyl, will more easily take any peculiar *Tincture* from it, then an

other *Part*, which is not so susceptive, and hath been tinctur’d already.
All the strange varieties in *Carnations*, *Tulips*, and other *Flowers* are
made this way.

31. §. The other *Rule* is, To change the *Soyl*, or frequently to
transplant from one *Bed* to another. By which means, the *Plant*, is as
it were, *superimpregnated* with several *Tinctures*, which are prolifick
of several *Colours*; which way is taken for *Roots* and *Slips*.

32. §. The consideration whereof, and of the foregoing *Experiments*,
may direct us not only in changing the *Bed*, but also in compounding
the *Soyl*, as by mixing such and such *Salts*, or *Bodies* impregnated
with such *Salts*, I say by mixing these Bodies in such a proportion,
with the *Soyl*, as although they have no *Colour* in themselves, yet
may be effectual to produce a great variety of *Colours* in the *Plants* they
nourish; supplying the *Plants* with such *Tinctures*, as shall concur
with the *Aer*, to strike or precipitate their *Sulphur* into so many several
*Colours*, after the manner above explicated: and so to bring even
Natures Art of *Painting*, in a great part, into our own power.
