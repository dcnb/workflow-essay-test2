### CHAP. IV.

### Of the GRAPE, and HAZEL-NUT; with some
    other Fruits, analogous to each of them.

![A](images/i_drop_a_156.jpg)

GRAPE, is a *Plum* with two *Stones*; for their
thickness, as hard as any other. *Tab. 69.* The *Distribution*
of the *Vessels* is also somewhat different. For the
principal *Fibres* running up directly betwixt the
*Stones*; and the smaller, making only one single
*Net*, near the Circumference; they all meet together
at the *Top* of the *Grape*. It is also to be noted,
That many *Lignous Fibres* are visibly mixed with the *Skin* it self:
whereby it becomes very thick and tough. And as the *Aer-Vessels* in
the *Trunk* of a *Vine*, are greater than in that of an *Apple*, *Pear*, or *Plum*:
So is it to be presumed, that in a *Grape*, they are greater than in the
*Fruits* of those *Trees*.

2. §. The *Parenchyma* or *Pulp* of a *Grape*, seems to be derived,
not from the *Barque*, as in an *Apple*; nor partly from the *Barque*, and
partly from the *Pith*, as in a *Goosberry*; but wholly from the *Pith*;
at least, as far as the *Reticulation* of the *Fibres*; and the *Skin* only from
the *Barque*; whereby the *Pulp* becomes so tender and delicate a *Meat*.

3. §. A GOOSBERRY, hath a Threefold *Parenchyma*. The
Utmost is derived from the *Barque*; of a *Greener Colour*, and very
*Sappy*. The midlemost, from the *Pith*; somewhat *white*, and more
*dry*, as the *Diametral Insertions* in some *Roots*. In both of them, the
*Bladders* are very conspicuous, above what they are in any *Fruit*, I at
present think of; so as to be visible to a good Eye without a *Glass*. *Tab. 69.*

4. §. Betwixt these Two *Parenchymas*, do run most of the principal
*Fibres*, or *Vascular Threds*. *Tab. 69.* From which several smaller ones are
branched into the Inmost *Parenchyma*; upon which, the *Seeds* do hang.

5. §. Each of these smaller *Branches* is invested with some part of
the midle or white *Parenchyma*. Serving partly to make the *Covers* of
the *Seed*; and partly, the *Pulp*, that is, the Inmost and finest *Parenchyma*
of the *Berry*, in which the *Seed* lies.

6. §. A *White* CORIN, without taking off the *Skin*, sheweth not
unpleasantly how the *Seeds* are fastned. For as the *Trunk* of the *Tree*
continues not to any considerable Length, entire, as in a *Plum*, but
is presently divided into several *Boughs*; nor are the Edges of the *Leaf*
entire, as also in a *Plum*, but slit into several *Lobes*; and the *Fruit*, into
a great many *Corins* in a *Bunch*: So again, the *Seeds* do hang upon
the *Fibres*, like Two other *Bunches*, in every *Corin*. As by *Refraction*,
Objects of all *Sizes* are represented on the *Walls* of the *Eye*. The
*Operations* of *Nature* being every where Uniform: and sometimes the
same in small, transcribed from a greater *Copy*.

7. §. A NUT, is a *Plum* inverted, or turned inside outward.
For the *Shell*, standing naked, includes the *Parenchyma*: the bearded
*Cap*, not precisely answering to *that*, but to the *Empalement* of the
*Flower*; *Tab. 69.* which likewise in many other *Plants*, out-lives the *Foliature*
and Embosomes the *Uterus* of the *Seed*. And whereas the *Stone* of a
*Plum* is not Faced, but Lined with a *Parenchyma* derived at second hand
from the *Pith*: The *Shell* of a *Nut* is not Lined, but Faced with the
iner *Skin* of the *Cap*.

8. §. AN AKERN, is the *Nut* of an *Oak*. Yet with this difference;
That besides the *Cup*, it stands in, it hath only a *Leathern* or
*Parchment Cover* instead of a *Shell*. From whence it come to pass, that
whereas the *Kernel* of a *Nut* is sweet; that of an *Akern*, is of a very
rough *Tast*: the *Austere Parts* of the *Sap*, which in a *Nut* are drained
off into the *Shell*, being here imbibed by the *Kernel* it self.
