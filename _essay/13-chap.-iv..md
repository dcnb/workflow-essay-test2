### CHAP. IV.

### Of the WOOD.

![T](images/i_drop_t_148.jpg)
HAT
 Portion of the *Root* which standeth next
within the *Barque*, and in *Trees*, and *Shrubby
Plants*, is the *Wood*; is also compounded of
Two Substantially different Bodies, *Parenchymous*
and *Lignous*. The *Parenchymous*, is of
the same Substantial Nature with that of the
*Barque*. And is originated from it; being not
only adjacent to it, but all round about continuous
therewith; even as that, is with the
*Skin*; the *Parenchyma* of the *Barque*, being distributed, from time to
time, partly outward into the *Skin*, and partly inward, into the
*Wood*.

2. §. The Position of the several parts hereof, is different. For the
most part it hath a Diametral Continuation, in several Portions, running
betwixt as many more of the *Lignous*, from the Circumference
towards the Center of the *Root*: all together, constituting that, which
in the *Second Chapter* of the *First* **Book**, I call the *Insertment*. In the
*Roots* of many *Herbs*, these Diametral or Inserted Portions are more
observable, as in *Cumfry*; *Tab. 9.* which leadeth to the notice of them in all
others, both of *Herbs* and *Trees*. Sometimes part of this *Parenchymous*
Body is disposed into *Rings*, as in *Fenil*. The Number and Size
of which Rings differ: In *Fenil*, when the *Root* is grown large, they
are in some places broader, but fewer; *Tab. 8, 9.* in *Beet* they are narrower, but
more. The Diametral Portions are here, in like manner, much varied;
in *Cumfry*, *Celandine*, larger; in *Beet*, *Bugloss*, meaner; in *Borage*,
*Parsnep*, more, and smaller; and in most Woody-*Roots*, streaming
betwixt the *Pith* and the *Barque*, as so many small Rays. Their
Continuation is also different; in some *Roots*, to the Centre, as in *Columbine*;
in others not, as in *Parsnep*. *Tab. 17.* And sometimes different in the
same *Root*, as in the *Vine*.

3. §. The Contexture of these *Parenchymous* Portions is sometimes
Uniform, as in *Bugloss*, *Peony*; and sometimes also, as it is in the
*Barque*, different; in part, more sappy, and transparent; in part,
more white, dry, and aery, as in *Carrot*, *Lovage*, *Scorzonera*, and
others; which yet cannot be observed without a wary view. But
their general Texture is the same being all made up of many small *Bladders*.
Which are here of different Sizes, like those of the *Barque*, but
for the most part smaller. Their Shape likewise, is usually Round;
but sometimes Oblong and Oval, as in *Borage*; or Oblong and Square,
as in the *Vine*. *Tab. 17.*

4. §. The *Lignous Part*, if not always, yet usually, is also Compounded
of Two Kinds of *Bodies*, *scil.* *Succiferous* or *Lignous* and *Aer-Vessels*.
The *Lignous* as far as discernable, are of the same Conformation
and Nature with those of the *Barque*, and in the transverse cut

of the *Root*, do oftentimes, as those, emit a *Liquor*. They are also
Braced; and many of them run in distinct *Threds* or Portions, collaterally
together.

5. §. The *Aer Vessels* I so call, because they contain no *Liquor*, but
an *Aery Vapour*. They are, more or less, visible in all *Roots*. They may
be distinguished, to the bare Eye, from the *Parenchymous Parts*, by their
Whiter Surface; and their standing more prominent, wheras those
shrink below the transverse level of the *Root*, upon drying. They are
frequently Conjugated divers of them together, sometimes fewer, and
for the most part single, as in *Asparagus*; *Tab. 10, & 15.* sometimes many, as in *Hors-Radish*.
And their Conjugations are also Braced, as the Threds of the
*Succiferous Vessels*. But they are no where Inosculated: nor Twisted
one about another; but only Tangent or Collateral. Neither are they
Ramified, the greater into less; but are all distinctly continued, as
the *Nerves* in *Animals*, from one end of the *Root* to the other.

6. §. Their Braces, as those of the *Succiferous Vessels*, are also of
various number: in *Jerusalem Artichoke*, *Cumfry*, *Scorzonera*, more rare;
in *Borage*, *Burnet*, more frequent; as by stripping off the *Barque* of
such *Roots*, where it is easily separable, may be seen. *Tab. 6.* And they often
vary in the same *Root*; so in *Borage*, *Scorzonera*, &c. they are more
frequent in the Centre, and next the *Barque*, than in the Intermediate
space, as by splitting those *Roots* down the middle doth appear. *Tab. 6.* They
also vary from those of the *Succiferous Vessels*; those being usually more
frequent, as in *Jerusalem Artichoke*, than these of the *Aerial*.

7. §. Betwixt these Braced *Aer-Vessels*, and the rest, which make
the true *Wood*, run the *Parenchymous Parts* above described; *Tab. 6.* as they
do betwixt the *Succiferous* in the *Barque*: and so make up two Pieces
of *Net Work*, wherof one is the filling up of the other.

8. §. The Position of both these Kinds of *Vessels*, is Various. The
*Succiferous* or *Lignous*, are sometimes posited in diametral lines or portions;
as in the *Vine*, and most *Trees*. *Tab. 17.* Sometimes, oppositely to the
*Aerial*, as in *Beet*; *Tab. 8.*
 each Ring herein being double, and made both of
*Sap-* and *Aer-Vessels*.

9. §. In *Nettle* the Position is very peculiar, *Tab. 8.* from what it is in the
*Roots* of other *Herbs*; being curiously mixed; the *Succiferous* running
cross the *Aerial*, in several, *viz.* *Five*, *Six*, *Seven*, or more *Rings*.
In *Bryony* the several Conjugations of the *Aerial*, are distinctly surrounded
with the *Succiferous*. *Tab. 7.* In *Patience*, the *Succiferous* are disposed,
besides Rays, into many small Rings, of different Sizes, sprinkled up
and down, and not, as in other *Roots* having one common Centre;
within divers whereof, the *Aer-Vessels* are included: especially within
those which are drawn, not into *Rings*, but, as it were, into little
stragling *Hedges*.

10. §. That also of the *Aer-Vessels*, is Various and Elegant: especially
in the upper part of the *Root*. In *Ammi*, *Lilium-non-bulbosom*,
they make a Ring. In these, a Prick’d-Ring; in *Peony*, a Ring of
Rays; in *Valerian*, a Ring of Pricks and Rays.
 *Tab. 7, 8, 9.* In others, they make
not Rings, but longer Rays, extended either towards the Centre,
as in *Scorzonera*; or meeting in it, as in *Columbine*. In the Common
*Dock*, they stand more in single Rays: in the other *Species* of *Docks*,
both in Rays, and collateral Conjugations between.

11. §. In *Beet*, they stand in several Rings; and every Ring,
made of Rays. In *Cumfry*, the Rays and Rings are separate; those
stand without, these next the Centre. *Tab. 8, 9.* In *Dandelion*, they stand altogether,
and make a little Rope, in the Center it self. In *Geranium*,
and others of that Kindred, they make a little Thred, in the same
place. And in *Skirret*, they stand in two Threds, near the Centre.

12. §. In *Celandine*, they stand in almost parallel Lines.
 *Tab. 8, 9.* In
*Monks-hood*, of a wedged Figure; divided in the smaller part of the
*Root*, into Three little Wedges, with their poynts meeting exactly
in the Centre. In *Cincquefoyle*, and *Strawberry*, they are also postur’d
in three Conjugations, triangularly. In the young *Roots* of *Oak*,
they stand neither in Radiated, nor otherwise strait, but Winding
Lines. And in *Borage* the position, of many of them, is Spiral. As
likewise, sometimes, in *Mercury*, or *Lapathum unctuosum*. *Tab. 15.* In *Horse-Radish*,
they stand more confused neither in Rings nor in Rays; yet
their several Conjugations, are radiated: with very many other differences.

13. §. The Quantity of these *Vessels*, as to the space they take up
in the *Root*, is to be computed Two ways, By their Number, and
Size. Their Number may, in some *Roots*, and in some measure, be
judged of, by the bare Eye; having, frequently, a whiter surface
than the other *Parts*. As also their Size; the Bore of these *Vessels* being
greater than that of the *Lignous* in all *Roots*; especially in some.
For if you take the *Roots* of *Vine*, *Fenil*, *Dandelion*, *Plum-tree*, *Elder*,
*Willow*, &c. and lay them by, for some time, to dry; and then,
having cut off a very thin Slice of each, transversely; if you hold up
those Slices before your Eye, so as the Light may be trajected through
the said *Vessels*, they hereby become visible, as notably different, both
in Number and Size.

14. §. But undeceitful and accurate Observation of both their
Number, and Size, must be made by the *Microscope*; and so they will
appear to be much more various. In *Bistort*, *Skirret*, they are very
few; in *Beet*, very many: betwixt which extreams there are all Degrees;
as in *Orpine*, *Venus Looking-Glass*, *Scorzonera*, Great *Celandine*,
*Peony*, *Borage*, *Fenil*, &c. may be seen. So their Size, in some is extream
small, as in *Strawberry*, *Bistort*, *Valerian*; in others very great,
as in *Asparagus*, *Bugloss*, *Vine*. They are also of several Sizes in one
and the same Numerical *Root*; but in some, are less varied, as in *Lilium
non bulbosum*, *Asparagus*, *Bugloss*; in others, more, as in *Bryony*,
*Lovage*. *Tab. 10. to 17.* Amongst all *Roots*, they vary by about Twenty Degrees;
as by comparing the *Roots* of *Vine*, *Thorn-Apple*, *Bryony*, *Lovage*,
*Fenil*, Wild *Carrot*, *Saxifrage*, *Parsley*, *Peony*, *Hore-hound*, *Cinquefoyl*,
*Strawberry*, &c. together, may be seen. Some of those in the *Vine*,
being of the greatest Size; appearing through a good *Glass*, at least
one Third of an Inch in Diametre: those in *Strawberry*, and that
Kind, of the smallest; most of them appearing, in the same *Glass*,
no bigger, than to admit the poynt of a small Pin, according to
the Standard, in *Tab. 12.* See also the Figures of so many of them
as are drawn.

15. §. In some *Roots*, they are Small, and Few; as in *Jerusalem
Artichoke*; in others Small, but Many, as in *Horse-Radish*:
 *Tab. 11, 14, 15, 17.* in *Bugloss*,
they are Great, but Few; in the *Vine*, Great and Many. So that the
proportion, which those of a *Vine*, their Number and Size being taken
together, bear to those of *Jerusalem Artichoke*, may be, at least, as Fifty,
to One. Of the smallest Kinds, as those of *Cinquefoyl*, *Jerusalem Artichoke*,
and the like; It is to be noted, That they are scarce ever visible
in the fresh Slices of these *Roots*; but after they have layn by a while, at
last, by a good *Glass*, Clear Light, and steddy View, are discernable.

16. §. In some *Roots*, the greater of these *Vessels* stand in or next
the Centre, *Tab. 13, 15.* as in *Taraxacum*, or *Dandelion*; in others next the circumference,
as in *Horse-Radish*. Sometimes each of them is from one end of
the *Root* to the other, of a more equal Size, or more Cylindrical, as in
*Marsh-mallow*; but usually, they widen, more or less, from the Top,
to the Bottom of the *Root*, as in *Thorn-Apple*: about the Top of which,
they are, for the most part, but of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth,
Magnitude; some of the Fifth, but none of the Third; but about the
Bottome, they are most of the Third, and Fifth: whence it is manifest,
That some of them are, in the manner of *Veins*, somewhat Pyramidal.
Yet is it observable, That their ampliation proceedeth not towards, but
from their Original, as in *Nerves*.

17. §. Of these *Vessels* Seignior *Malpighi* hath observed; *Componuntur*
(saith he) *expositæ fistulæ Zona tenui & pellucida, velut argentei
coloris lamina, parum lata; quæ, spiraliter locata, & extremis lateribus
unita, Tubum, interius & exterius aliquantulum asperum, efficit.*

18. §. To whose Observation I further add, That the *Spiral
Zone*, or *Lamina*, as he calls it, is not ever one Single *Piece*; but consisteth
of Two or More round and true *Fibres*, although standing collaterally
together, yet perfectly distinct. Neither are these Single *Fibres*
themselves *flat*, like a *Zone*; but of a *round* forme, like a most fine
*Thred*. According as fewer or more of these *Fibres* happen to break off,
from their Spiral location, together; the *Zone* is narrower, or broader:
usually, Narrower in the *Trunk*, and Broader in the *Root*.

19. §. Of these *Fibres* I also Observe, That they are not *Inosculated*
side to side, but are *Knit* together by other smaller *Fibres*; those being,
as it were, the *Warp*, and these the *Woof* of the *Aer-Vessels*. Yet
I think the several *Fibres* are not interwoven just as in a *Web*; but by
a kind of Stitch, as the several *Plates* or *Bredths* of a Floor-Mat. A
clear and elegant sight of these *Fibres*, and of their *Interweftage*, by
splitting a *Vine-Root*, or a piece of *Oak*, may, with a good *Glass* in the
sides of their Greater *Aer-Vessels*, be obtained; having much of the resemblance
of *Close Needle-work*.

20. §. The Spiration of the *Fibres* of these *Vessels*, may more easily
be observed in the *Trunk*, than in the *Root*. And better in younger
*Plants*, than other. And not so well by Cutting as by Splitting, or by
Tearing off some small Piece, through which they *run*: their Conformation
being, by this means, not spoiled. Yet this way, the *Vessels* are
seen, chiefly, *Unresolved*.

21. §. But in the *Leaves* and Tender *Stalks* of all such *Plants*, as
shew, upon breaking, a kind of *Doune* or *Wool*; they may be seen
*Resolved* and Drawn out, and that some times even to the naked Eye,

an Inch or two Inches in length. This *Wool* being nothing else, but a
certain number of *Fibres* Resolved from their Spiral position in these
*Vessels*, and Drawn out in Length; and so clustred together, as so many
*Threds* or little *Ropes*: appearing thus more or less, in the *Leaves* and
some other *Parts* of most *Plants*; but more remarquably in some, as
in the *Vine*, *Scabious*, and others. As also in the Scales of a *Squill*. In
which last, for example, they are so easily separable, as further to
shew, what before was observed; *viz.* That the *Plate* or *Zone*, into
which the *Aer-Vessels* are usually Resolved, is not one Single Piece, or
meer *Plate*; but made up of several Round *Fibres*, all standing and
running parallel, and so knit together by other smaller ones, tranversly,
in the form of a *Zone*. For if you break or cut a *Leaf* or *Shell*
of a fresh *Squill*, till you come to the *Aer-Vessels*, and having softly
drawn them out, for about an Inch or more (to the naked Eye) in
length, you then single out one or two of them from the rest, and
rowl them, as they hang at the *Shell*, eight or nine times round, each
*Vessel* will appear, through a *Glass*, to consist of 8, 10, or 12 small
*Fibres*; which, in the Unresolved *Vessel*, run parallel; but by this
means, are all separated one from another. See the *Figures* belonging
to the *Third* and *Fourth* **Books**.

22. §. The Process of their Spiration, is not, so far as I have observed,
accidental, but constantly the same; *scil.* In the *Root*, by
*South*, from *West* to *East*: But in the *Trunk*, contrarily, by *South*,
from *East* to *West*.

23. §. The *Content* of these *Vessels*, is, as hath already been intimated,
more *Aery*. The Arguments for which, are, That upon a
transverse Cut of the *Root*, the *Sap* ascendeth not there, where
These stand. Being also viewed through a *Microscope*, they are never
observed to be filled with *Liquor*. Besides a *Root* cut and immersed in
Water, till the Water is in some part got into these *Vessels*, and then
the *Root* taken out and crushed; the other *Parts* will yield *Liquor*,
but These, only *Bubbles*: which *Bubbles* are made, by some small
quantity of *Liquor* mixed with the *Aer*, before contained in the said
*Vessels*. To which, other Arguments will arise out of those Things
that follow in the *Second* **Part**. As also for this *Content*, its not being
a pure or simple, but *Vaporous Aer*. Whether these *Vessels* may
not, in some *Vegetables*, and at some times, contain *Liquor*, is doubtful.⁠[2]
Thus far of the *Lignous Part*.
