### Scene I

*It is an afternoon some days later. There is a small table near
            the bar with a water carafe and a glass, a hand bell and papers on
            it. Chairs are arranged round it in a circle as if for a meeting.
            Otherwise the scene is unchanged.*

Mr. Lingley *is pacing up and down the room in an agitated manner,
            watch in hand.*

Lingley. Four thirty⁠—four thirty *one*! Tut,
            tut, tut! (*Goes to table.*) Late, late. Now let’s
            see⁠—(*Counting the chairs.*) Mrs. Cliveden-Banks⁠—Mr.
            Duke⁠—two⁠—four⁠—six⁠—(*Touching armchair at head and fingering water
            bottle.*) Myself here⁠—yes that’s right. (*The syren is heard.
            Takes out watch again.*) Four thirty one and a half⁠—four thirty
            *two*. Oh, tut, tut, tut! (Tom *walks in from the deck.*
            Lingley *stops in his walk on seeing him.*) Good gracious, fancy
            *you* being the first!

Tom. First for what?

Lingley. The meeting, sir!

Tom. Oh, I’d forgotten about your rotten old meeting.

Lingley. Where are the others?

Tom. On deck. It may interest you to know we’ve just sighted
            land. (*Sits above table.*)

Lingley. Land, Mr. Prior? Land! (*Delighted.*)

Tom. Yes. We’ve just sighted *hell*.

Lingley. Oh.

Tom. It looks quite a jolly little spot from here. The padre’s
            arranging a sweepstake on the exact time it will take us to get in.
            He’s suddenly developed a sense of humour.

Lingley. Sense of humour and sweepstakes when we’re
            all⁠—all⁠—! What’s the use of a sense of humour to a dead man?
            (*Pacing to and fro up and down.*)

Tom. I dunno! I’ve never asked one.

Lingley. Oh, why don’t they *come*?

Tom. You’re getting the wind up a bit, aren’t you? Oh, I don’t
            blame you, Lingley of Lingley Limited, for I shouldn’t be surprised if
            over there a nice private little gridiron isn’t being warmed up for
            your personal reception. (*Goes to table and sits down.*)

Lingley. Will you be quiet, you foolish boy!

(Scrubby *enters left.*)

Scrubby (*indicating the table*). Everything correct, sir?

Lingley. Eh?

Scrubby. Enough chairs, sir?

Lingley. Oh! yes, very nice indeed, very nice, Mr. Scrubby.
            Er⁠—here is half-a-crown for your trouble. Thank you.

Scrubby. Thank *you*, sir.

Lingley. What for? Half-a-crown is no use to me now. Wait!
            Please tell the others⁠—the others⁠—my shipmates⁠—that they’re late for
            the meeting.

Scrubby (*as he goes*). Certainly, sir.

Lingley. Thank you, Mr. Scrubby, thank you.

Tom. What’s the object of this meeting, anyway?

Lingley. Can’t you see?

Tom. Yes. That’s why I asked.

Lingley. We’re approaching our destination, and I want to
            make this one last effort. I feel we should talk the matter over in a
            rational spirit⁠—and as a business man I’ve called this meeting.

Tom. You would. And, as has probably been your custom, you
            think that a committee report and minutes, and balance sheets and
            all that bunkum may impress the examiner as they do shareholders and
            *other* examiners. Of course you’ll be chairman?

Lingley. Naturally. I seem to be the only one qualified.

Tom. You admit it.

Lingley. By right of experience and proved ability⁠—Prior,
            when I was a boy⁠—

Tom. Were you ever a boy? Poor parents!

Lingley. When I was seventeen I could only manage one egg for
            breakfast.

Tom. I can never manage *any* breakfast myself.

Lingley. *Afford* one egg, I mean. At six thirty a.m. I
            used to walk to my work.

Tom. On the egg?

Lingley. And after business I’d walk home again. That was the
            beginning of Lingley Limited. When I was seventeen I made my motto “Try
            to rely on yourself.” At thirty-seven I made it “Rely on yourself.”

Tom. So you fired *me*.

Lingley. At forty-seven I made it “Rely on yourself
            *absolutely*”; because if you fail all your friends will only say
            “It serves you right.”

Tom. *Had* you any friends at forty-seven?

Lingley. You’re incorrigible! And I thought *you* were
            concerned in this⁠—this dilemma.

Tom. I *am*.

(Mrs. Cliveden-Banks *enters through the centre door. She is in the
            very deepest mourning.*)

Mrs. C-Banks. I must apologise for being late! I’ve been
            playing sweepstake.

Lingley. Mrs. Cliveden-Banks! Why this dress?

Mrs. C-Banks. Our present circumstances!

(Tom *sits⁠—his attitude toward the subsequent proceedings is one
            of contempt.*)

Lingley. Will you sit here?

Mrs. C-Banks. It’s nice to be able to, isn’t it? (*Sits in
            the first chair left of table.*) And the object of this meeting, Mr.
            Lingley is⁠—er⁠—?

Lingley. Well⁠—er⁠—is this company alive or dead?

Tom. And the next question on the agenda?

Lingley (*a pause. Sits*). What is going to happen to us?
            Mr. Prior⁠—as a prospective shareholder⁠—I ask you what you think?

Tom. Lingley⁠—do you know anything about Elizabethan furniture?

Lingley. Nothing whatever.

Tom. Neither do I. That’s why I never talk about it.

Lingley. But it is the right thing to do isn’t it?

Tom. To solemnly sit down and discuss if we’ve immortal souls
            or if we haven’t? And if we have, to pool ’em. (*Sarcastically.*)
            Undoubtedly. (*Rises.*) “We must combine”⁠—the most hopeful refuge
            for an embarrassed business man like you.

Lingley. Exactly. We must all face this examiner together.

(Rev. W. Duke *enters. He is quite different and most cheerful.*)

Duke. Hello, Tom! Hello, Lingley! (*To* Mrs.
            Cliveden-Banks): Hello, Banky!

Mrs. C-Banks. Banky!

Duke. Yes. (*He shakes her shoulders.*) Banky, Banky!
            We’re dead now so my job’s over and I can be quite natural; do what
            I like and say what I like, Banky. (*Over* Lingley’s *right
            shoulder.*) Prior, have you heard this one⁠—I’ve been dying to
            spring it for ages⁠—“There was a young girl of Hong-Kong.”

Mrs. C-Banks (*convulsed with laughter*). Oh, *I*
            know that one.

Lingley. Sir! You ought to be ashamed of yourself. We are
            about to hold a Board Meeting.

Duke. Sorry. I overheard one of my ex-choir boys reciting
            that in the Vestry. I remember his voice was breaking at the time. Damn
            badly. (*Sits below* Tom.)

Lingley. Supposing your Bishop heard you say “damn.”

Duke. Impossible, unless he’s listening in.

Lingley. You’ve evidently become unbalanced.

Mrs. Midget (*entering centre*). Is this the meeting
            ’ouse?

Lingley. Yes, Mrs. Midget. Sit here will you? Very good of you
            to come. I hope you⁠—your family are well and⁠—

Mrs. Midget (*sits above table right of* Lingley). What
            the ’ell are you talking about?

Mrs. C-Banks. Please do not mention hell, Mrs. Midget, it’s a
            rather ticklish subject at the moment.

Lingley. Now, are we all here?

Tom. We’re all here.

Mrs. Midget. The young couple aren’t ’ere.

Lingley. *They* never say anything, anyway. Shall we
            begin?

Mrs. C-Banks. Begin.

Lingley. Very well, then. (*Rises.*) Ahem! (*Rings bell
            on table.*)

Tom. They’re off!

Lingley. Ladies and gentlemen⁠—

Mrs. Midget. ’Ear, ’Ear!

Mrs. C-Banks. Be quiet!

Mrs. Midget. I was only thanking ’im for the compliment.

Lingley. Ladies *and* gentlemen⁠—“de mortuis nil nisi
            bonum.”

Tom. Oh, get on with it!

Lingley. I intend to. *Ladies* and gentlemen⁠—I am a
            business man.

Duke. Quite.

Lingley. I have never done anything in my life without a
            reason.

Duke. Quite.

Lingley. I would like firstly, therefore, to explain that my
            reason for calling this meeting, is, if I may put it in this manner, to
            draw up a clean balance sheet.

Duke. Quite.

Lingley. Now, secondly⁠—if I may say so⁠—

Tom. You may say anything you like, old boy, only for goodness
            sake say it.

Lingley. Sir! I⁠—

Mrs. C-Banks. Order, please. Order.

Tom. I’ll have the same, with a splash.

Lingley. Oh, please don’t all keep interrupting.

Mrs. C-Banks. Well, they always say “order” at meetings⁠—

Duke. Quite!

Lingley. Where was I?

Duke. Drawing up a balance sheet.

Tom. “Laughter.”

Lingley. And trying to explain my reason for doing so.

Duke. Quite.

Tom. Quite *what*?

Lingley. My reasons⁠—

Tom. *Have* you any?

Lingley. (*Sits down in disgust.*) I shall say no more.

Tom. *Good.*

Mrs. Midget. Oh, sir, don’t rob the gentleman of his
            amusement! ’E may not ’ave much more opportunity.

Lingley. I only thought in view of the shortness of time
            at our command, *and* the nature of the harbour we are rapidly
            approaching,⁠—I shall therefore call on Mr. Duke for a few words. He
            should, professionally, know more of the matter than we do. Ahem! The
            Rev. W. Duke, M.C.

Duke (*without rising*). All I can say is⁠—if we
            *are* all dead then let us hope we have done our jobs to the best
            of our ability.

Lingley. I’ve never been late for an appointment in my life.

Duke. And now that we’re nearing this⁠—this dread examiner,
            we think something should be done. And we’ve put off really thinking
            what to do till the last moment. Naturally we *would*, we’re all
            English.

Mrs. C-Banks. Rule Britannia!

Duke. You ask for my professional advice! I have none to give.
            The Steward himself has none to give.

Mrs. Midget. You might pray for us, sir.

Duke. I would if I thought my prayer would be worth anything.
            But now I don’t understand. To pray for something one doesn’t
            understand is to be an idolater.

Mrs. Midget. Oh, we mustn’t be one of those.

Duke. It’s the first time in my⁠—it’s the first *time*
            I’ve never known what to do. It’s a strange business, this being dead.
            (*The drum is heard again.* Ann *and* Henry *appear in the
            centre. A pause and then the* Rev. Duke *notices the couple.*)
            Oh, come in. (Ann *and* Henry *come in and stand away from the
            others.*) By the way, I suppose we’re all agreed on that point?

Lingley. What point?

Tom. Ask these two.

Lingley. What point?

Duke. *Are we all dead or are we not?*

Lingley. That’s what I called this meeting to decide.
            (*To*  Ann *and* Henry.) You two, won’t you sit down? (*No
            reply, they simply huddle closer together, and stand aloof left.*)
            No? No. Very well, then. The motion in front of us is I think perfectly
            plain to all. “Are we⁠—” Who will speak first?

Mrs. C-Banks. I will. For I think it’s a most impertinent
            question to be asked. If I am dead, why can’t I be dead in private?
            Personally, I believe I *am* dead. My corsets have never fitted so
            comfortably anyway.

Lingley. Mr. Prior?

Tom. I *know*. And I don’t care a damn one way or the
            other.

Mrs. C-Banks. The man’s a plebiscite.

Lingley. Mr. Duke?

Duke. Agreed. Mr. Lingley?

Lingley (*pause*). I agree. Mrs. Midget?

Mrs. Midget. Ladies and gents, all I want to know is this, and
            I really don’t know what’s goin’ on. But if it *’as* ’appened⁠—it
            would greatly please me to know that I’ve been *done proper*.

Lingley. I beg your pardon.

Mrs. Midget. You know, the street, the neighbours, the sherry
            wine and cake⁠—and flowers.

Lingley. This is beside the point⁠—do you think you’re dead or
            do you not?

Mrs. Midget. Oh, I leave it entirely to you, sir.

Lingley. I take it in favour of the motion. And now you two
            young people?

Tom. They know. They’ve always known.

Lingley. Please, please, let them answer for themselves. Well?
            Well, what do you say?

Henry. We have nothing to say.

Lingley. I suppose we must disregard your evidence. As far as
            the rest of us are concerned, I think there is nothing more to be done
            than to enter the verdict that this board (*commences to write*)
            “certifies itself to be dead.” And the next thing for me to decide⁠—is
            the most effective way⁠—in all our interests⁠—to meet and talk with
            this examiner.

Tom. Do you mean we want to get out of it if we can?

Lingley. If we can. Well⁠—er⁠—if we can’t⁠—we want to get out
            of it as lightly as we can.

Mrs. C-Banks. Go on.

Lingley. And we’re under a great disadvantage. You see we do
            not know what sort of a person this examiner is, who is suddenly to
            pounce upon us. He is bound to be a hard, stern business man. In which
            case, I suggest I am one best fitted to deal with him.

Tom. Hear, hear!

Duke. Supposing he isn’t anything like that? Supposing
            he is something even *you* can’t understand? Supposing he is
            really *the* examiner? Don’t you think we all ought to speak for
            ourselves?⁠—if we can.

Lingley. It’s if we *can’t* I’m thinking of.

Duke. I wish we knew. I certainly wish we knew.

(Scrubby *enters from behind bar.*)

Mrs. C-Banks. Why not ask that steward person about him? They
            must have met before.

Tom. Not a bad idea at all, Mrs. Cliveden-Banks.

Lingley. The steward! Exactly, will someone go and fetch him?

Scrubby. You want *me*, sir?

Lingley. What the⁠—!

Scrubby. I have been here all the time.

Lingley. But, we⁠—

Scrubby. You wanted to ask me about the examiner, sir.

Lingley. Yes, if you would be so good.

Scrubby. What did you want to know exactly, sir?

Lingley. Well, he can’t be tipped, that of course is
            obvious⁠—but between ourselves⁠—what sort of a person is he?

Scrubby. I can’t say. I don’t know. It all depends.

Lingley. Depends on what?

Scrubby. Yourselves, sir. I have seen some men and women
            before him cry for⁠—but no, I can’t say.

Lingley. Tell us just this, Mr. Scrubby, what do you think we
            really ought to do⁠—how exactly should we approach him?

Scrubby. I have been asked that question nearly five thousand
            times, sir; I have always answered that it is better to leave the
            approaching to him. (*Starts to go out centre.*)

Duke. Scrubby, have I any chance?

Scrubby (*standing in door silhouetted against the golden
            light outside*). You *all* have chances, sir.

Duke. What’s he like?

Scrubby. He’s the wind and the skies and the earth, sir. He
            knows the furthest eddy of the high tide up the remotest cove. He knows
            the simpleness of beauty and the evilest thoughts of the human mind.
            He’ll know all your evil thoughts.

Duke (*quickly*). God!

Scrubby. Yes, sir, he will. (*Looks out on to the deck.*)
            Would you excuse me now, please. I can tell no more; and a seagull has
            just fallen on to the deck. I’m afraid it may have broken its wing. If
            so I must try and mend it.

Ann. Poor thing!

Scrubby. Yes, madam, it’s very sad the way the birds die in
            these strange waters. (*He walks off along the deck.*)

Duke. Just like the first day at school again.

Tom. *Now* do you want to deal with him⁠—collectively? Or
            will you just make yourself responsible for your own sins?

Lingley. Oh, come, come, come! We mustn’t all get jumpy.
            I still think we ought to be prepared though my own conscience is
            perfectly clear.

Mrs. C-Banks. Then you’d better worry about *ours*, dear
            Mr. Lingley. Come tabulate us, as it were.

Lingley. Excellent. Then I can put all the cases before
            this⁠—this examiner briefly and to the point.

Mrs. C-Banks. It should save us a great amount of trouble.

Lingley. So, if you will all just give me a few details about
            yourselves⁠—and any special little reference you might like me to bring
            forward, Mrs. Cliveden-Banks, let me start with you. What shall I say
            about *you* to this⁠—er⁠—examiner?

Mrs. C-Banks. I should just say I am⁠—or *was*⁠—Mrs.
            Cliveden-Banks⁠—and leave it at that.

Lingley. Um! Oh, very well; you, Mrs. Midget?

Mrs. Midget. Oh, I dun’no.

Lingley. Oh, dear, dear, dear! Is that really all?

Mrs. Midget. Yes, please, sir.

Lingley. All right⁠—not at all satisfactory but I suppose all
            right⁠—in my hands. I can answer for myself of course. You, Mr. Prior?

Tom. Oh, say, I’m an old drunk. Or rather a young one.

Lingley. That won’t help you very much.

Tom. How do *you* know?

Lingley. But you must have had some redeeming qualities that
            will help you? For instance, were you good to your mother or⁠—did you
            go to Oxford?

Tom. Put down the truth⁠—he will know it anyway.

Lingley. Really, you’re none of you being very helpful.
            (*Writes.*) A drunk⁠—er⁠—a Mrs. Cliveden-Banks⁠—er⁠—and an, I
            dunno.

Mrs. C-Banks. I should prefer to precede the drunk.

Lingley. Very well. (*To Henry.*) Now, sir, how can
            *you* assist me?

Henry. I can’t.

Lingley. But⁠—you then, madam?

Ann. He speaks for both of us.

Henry. We have nothing to say.

Lingley. It is really most discourteous of you! Mr. Duke, I
            can rely on *you* at any rate.

Duke. You can rely on me for *one* piece of information.

Lingley. Thank you very much.

Duke. I now entirely agree with Mr. Prior for calling you a
            pompous old idiot!

Tom. Cheers.

Lingley. What?⁠—just because I’m trying to do my duty!

Duke. Your duty! Your rubbish! You’re doing what you are
            because you’re in a blue funk! And I don’t blame you. I’m in a blue
            funk, too! But not so much as to make an utter ass of myself by trying
            to get out of this with balance sheets and board meetings! You want
            to try and impress this examiner with your cleverness, your business
            importance, your supposed interest in your fellow creatures. You’re
            hoping to save your own skin that way. And I think it’s pretty rotten!

Lingley. Indeed. Destructive criticism is very simple. Then
            perhaps *you* can advise me.

Duke. I can advise nothing.

Lingley. ’Um! That’s *very* useful.

Mrs. Midget. Oh, sir, not just *one* word of ’elp?

Duke. That is different. If I can *help* I will. But you
            mustn’t take anything I say in the nature of advice. The blind leading
            the blind, you know. I can only tell you what I am going to do myself,
            and I may be wrong.

Tom. *What* are you going to do, Duke? (*Staccato.*)

Duke. I have been trying to look into myself silently, trying
            to examine my past thoughtfully and humbly⁠—to seek out all the faults
            and not try to excuse them. But to know all that I am responsible for;
            and when I see my life, lying before me like a blurred map, I am going
            to pray to be able to make one more prayer. But for myself; I am not
            fit to pray for others. If any of you care to do likewise please do so
            if it will comfort you. Look back.

Mrs. C-Banks. I *could* look back, of course, but I don’t
            intend to. Remember Mrs. Lot.

Mrs. Midget. Thank you, sir.

Duke. No, no, now that’s just what I didn’t *want* you
            to do. You see, Mrs. Midget⁠—try to understand⁠—we’re just shipmates,
            you and I⁠—trying to help one another. I’m not a captain any longer,
            I cannot pray for others. Perhaps the realisation of that is the
            beginning of my punishment. I’ve *lost* my job.

Lingley. I don’t suppose it was worth much anyway.

Duke. It was the most glorious job in the world. I suppose
            a man never really knows he’s incompetent until he’s sacked,
            and I can’t, I can’t understand and I *ought* to. It’s my
            *job* to; and it’s beastly hard *not* to be able to. It’s
            heart-breaking⁠—it’s⁠—(*to* Prior)⁠—Give me a cigarette.

(*The syren is heard again.* Henry *moves away from* Ann.)

Lingley. Well, let’s get down to hard facts⁠—I suggest.

Duke. Too late. Didn’t you hear?

Lingley. What?

Ann. *I* heard.

Tom. What?

Duke. The syren.

Tom (*after a pause suddenly hysterical*). I didn’t hear
            anything⁠—I didn’t hear anything.

(Duke *and* Tom *rise.* Tom *knocks chair over.*)

Duke. Now, now, Prior.

Tom. I didn’t, I didn’t! (*Another pause.*) But I can
            feel something though, can’t you?

Duke. No.

Tom. The boat’s stopped.

Duke. Exactly. We’re in.

(*Another pause. The syren is repeated.*)

Tom. No, no! I won’t face it! I daren’t! It’s all been bluff
            on my part! Let me get away! Let me get⁠—!

Duke (*rising with hand on* Prior). Prior, my boy!

Tom. I can’t face it. I want to get away! Make the boat go on!

Ann. Henry! (*She gets closer to him.*)

Tom. Let me get away. (*Struggling to get away.*)

Duke. We can none of us get away. We’ve stopped for good now.
            This is the judgment.

Tom (*pulling himself together*). No, it can’t be. Here
            in the smoke-room of a liner?

Duke. Why *shouldn’t* it be here in the smoke-room
            of a liner? Have any of us really ever troubled very much to think
            where-and-how-and-when it might be?

Ann (*quietly*). Henry. They won’t *separate*
            us⁠—they *can’t*.

(Henry *merely holds her closer⁠—as if in defiance.*)

Duke. We’re for it now all right.

(Duke *sits right of table with his face buried in his hands.*)

Tom. We must stick together. Duke, man, you *must* pray
            even if the words are meaningless. Don’t desert duty at the last
            moment. We’re in the night and I want a prayer. I want a prayer from a
            man, I don’t care if he’s a clergyman or not.

Mrs. Midget (*going to* Duke). You *ought* to pray,
            your reverence.

Tom. Even if you can’t understand what for⁠—you understand
            *us*.

Duke. You really think I ought to, Mrs. Midget?

Mrs. Midget (*bending over him*). Yes, sir, pardon the
            liberty. There’s no ’arm in ’abits⁠—if they’re *good* ’abits; and
            prayer *is* a good ’abit.

Duke (*without rising⁠—but slowly facing front and
            with utter simplicity and sincerity*). Forgive me then, for
            I don’t know⁠—“Gentle Jesus, meek and mild, look upon a little
            child⁠—children⁠—pardon our simplicity, suffer us to come to Thee. God
            bless father and mother, Harriet (she was my nurse), all kind friends,
            make me a good boy. Amen.” That was the first prayer I ever learnt,
            so it’s probably the finest. Say it to yourselves if you want to; and
            remember⁠—Harriet⁠—she was a worthy soul.

Ann (*after a long pause*). Henry, let’s hide. (*She
            takes his hand and they drift off together, left.*)

Mrs. Midget. I feel better.

(Scrubby *enters from the left, giving a glance back as he does
            so.*)

Scrubby (*brightly⁠—and business-like*). We’re in, ladies
            and gentlemen, we’re in.

Duke. Yes, yes, we know.

Scrubby. The examiner is just coming on board. His cutter’s
            alongside. He’ll *be* with you in a second. (*He goes out on to
            the deck.*)

Duke. We can do nothing now.

Mrs. C-Banks (*in a whisper*). Mr. Lingley⁠—Mr. Lingley!
            (*She and Lingley have gone to wall seat at back⁠—where they sit.*)

Lingley. Well?

Mrs. C-Banks. Well⁠—hadn’t we better all stand up? (*All
            rise.*)

Lingley. Eh? Oh, yes, of course, it would be more polite.

Duke. Politeness!

Scrubby (*appearing and announcing*). The Examiner!

Tom (*quickly and quietly appealingly*). Duke!

Duke. Quiet.

(The Rev. Frank Thomson *is heard shouting off, Right.*)

Thomson. Hello, hello, hello there I say! Where is everyone?
            Where are you, Duke? (*He appears in the centre. An elderly and
            massive clergyman, rotund, rubicund and jovial. He is dressed in
            white drill and a topee. But he wears a clergyman’s collar and black
            bib.*) Ah, there you are! Duke, my old boy, how are you?

Duke. Good⁠—! My⁠—! Well⁠—! Well I’m dashed if it isn’t old
            “grease spot.” (*Crossing and shaking hands.*)

Thomson. It is, sir, and greasier than ever. Phew! This
            climate! Well, I am glad to see you after all this time. How are you,
            Duke? Have a good passage? You’re looking fit. (*Taking off topee and
            wiping forehead.*)

Duke. I’m not *feeling* it.

Thomson. I only heard this morning your boat was due in this
            afternoon, I’d seen your name on the passenger list of course⁠—so I
            hurried down especially to meet you, I’d been up country. (*Sits
            above table.*)

Duke. Thank you.

Thomson. Well, how goes everything. I’m bursting for news!
            How’s Fergusson⁠—still in the same old place?

Duke. No, they’ve made him a bishop now.

Thomson. Good lor’, they *would*. Well I hope he likes
            it. And what’s become of Maltby; and that little fellow with the red
            hair and spectacles? I never could remember his name. (*Lights a
            cigarette.*) And do you still go for your blow-out at Simpson’s
            every pay day, you young rascal? Tell me, what’s the meat like there
            now?

Duke (*greatly agitated and in no mood for Thomson’s
            frivolity*). Thomson, I’m delighted to see you again, of course, and
            I’m dying to tell you everything afterwards⁠—*if I can*⁠—but can’t
            you realise⁠—at this moment⁠—how terribly worried I am?

Thomson. Worried⁠—worried about what?

Duke. This⁠—this person.

Thomson. What person?

Duke. This person⁠—or whoever it is⁠—who’s just coming to
            examine us.

Thomson. The examiner! Oh, I shouldn’t worry about him!

Duke. What⁠—do⁠—you⁠—mean?

Thomson. *I’m* the examiner!

(*General movement.*)

Duke. You⁠—you are!

Thomson. Well, I’m one of ’em anyway. We’ve got dozens on the
            job. And they *will* shove all the duds on to it. My dear boy,
            our profession is not what it used to be. Terribly overcrowded, too,
            believe me.

Duke. You’re⁠—my⁠—examiner?

Thomson. Yes⁠—you’re under *my* orders now. And I tell
            you, my boy, you’ll have to mind your p’s and q’s; and *how*
            you’ll have to slog at it! But I’ve fixed your “digs” up for you all
            right, they’re not up to much, but clean, in the same house as myself;
            the old woman’s quite a decent sort. And it’s near your work, right in
            the centre of the parish so you couldn’t do better, really.

Duke. *Work?*

Thomson. I find it quite handy myself.

Duke. “Parish⁠—slog at it.” Thomson, Thomson, you don’t mean I
            haven’t lost my job after all? Don’t torture me, tell me quickly.

Thomson. Of course you haven’t lost it. You haven’t started it
            yet. You’re just beginning it.

Duke. Not lost my job? Still got my job. Oh, thank you! Oh,
            thank God! I will work harder now every moment, I swear I will, Mr.
            Thomson. Harder than ever! Oh, do you all hear? My job I was so keen
            on⁠—it’s not been taken from me after all. My⁠—oh! (*Sits right of
            table, left, and quietly cries*)⁠—job.

Thomson (*patting him on shoulder*). There, there, boy,
            there, there! Whatever made you think it would be taken from you?
            (*Duke sobs.*) There, there, it’s quite all right.

Mrs. C-Banks (*at back on the seat with* Lingley). I’m
            very glad to see they know each other so well⁠—but what about us?

Lingley. This might be a suitable moment to approach him.

Mrs. C-Banks. Try.

Lingley. I will (*importantly crossing to examiner who takes
            no notice*). Sir⁠—ahem⁠—my name is Lingley⁠—of Ling⁠—

Thomson. Go away.

Lingley. I have advocated myself⁠—or rather my fellow
            passengers have advocated me⁠—their spokesman as it were⁠—

Thomson (*still attending to* Duke). Go away.

Lingley. And I thought this might be a good moment to approach
            a somewhat⁠—

Thomson (*turning on him positively*). Will you go away,
            sir?

Lingley. Certainly. (*Retires.*) I’ve no wish to stay
            where I’m not wanted. (*Goes back to his seat.*)

Mrs. C-Banks. How very rude!

Lingley. I don’t believe he’s the examiner at all.

Mrs. C-Banks. Of course, Mr. Duke will get off lightly.
            (*Rises.*) A friend at court, you see. Influence! Ah! It’s always
            the same. Shall *I* say something to him?

Lingley. Good lor’, madam, *no*.

Thomson (*to* Duke). Feeling better now?

Duke. I’m very sorry, sir. But it means such a lot to me. You
            understand.

Thomson. Perfectly. I had exactly the same feeling when it
            happened to *me*. But you’ve nothing to worry about except your
            work.

Duke. I’m full of energy.

Thomson. Then you can start your apprenticeship now and help
            me with this bunch. By the way, there aren’t many of you.

Duke. No, sir.

Thomson. Then it won’t take long and we can get on shore for
            dinner.

Lingley. Sir, if I find my trial’s being “scamped” I shall
            appeal.

Thomson (*to* Scrubby). Take that man away, will you?

Scrubby. Certainly, sir. This way, Mr. Lingley.

Lingley (*as he goes out, left*). It’s disgraceful.

Thomson. And the rest had better wait *with* him⁠—outside.

Scrubby. Very good, sir. Will you all come this way, please?

Mrs. C-Banks (*making a large sweep towards* Thomson).
            How do you do? (*Seeing she is ignored she follows the others
            out.*) Oh!

(Tom *goes out, left, followed by* Mrs. Midget.)

Thomson. That’s all. (Scrubby *follows them off, left.*)
            Now, we’ll get to work.

Duke. Yes, sir.

Thomson. Let’s see; who have we got on board? (*Reads from
            his note-book.*) Cliveden-Banks, Midget, Prior and the officious
            gent who spoke to me⁠—yourself.

Duke. There’s an awfully nice quiet young couple.

Thomson. Oh? I don’t remember them. They’re not on the
            passenger list. We’ll begin with the officious one. (*Calls.*)
            Scrubby! (*Goes up centre and returns.*) Where’s that fellow got
            to?

Scrubby (*appearing*). Here, sir.

Thomson. Oh. (*Reading.*) Show in Mr. Feltmann.

Scrubby (*calling off left*). Mr. Feltmann!

Duke. There’s no Feltmann on board, Thomson!

Thomson. Isn’t there?

Scrubby (*calling off left louder*). Mr. Feltmann!!

Duke. Not that I know of.

(*There is a pause. Then* Thomson *rises, goes up to left
            opening and calls⁠—looking off as he does so.*)

Thomson. Feltmann, come here.

(*Then* Lingley *appears in the opening.*)

Lingley. You were looking at *me*?

Thomson. Yes. Come in. Sit down. (*Returns to seat.*)
            *There.*

(Lingley *comes slowly in and sits down.*)

Lingley. Well?

Thomson. Well, sir?

Lingley. You’ve made a mistake. My name’s Lingley, of Lingley,
            Ltd.

Thomson. Your name’s Feltmann. At least that was the name of
            your parents.

Lingley. No, sir. My name’s Lingley. And I’m sorry to see you
            mixing up things to begin with. I’m a business man and mistakes annoy
            me. You see, my fellow passengers have practically left everything in
            my hands. Now if you’ll just put your cards on the table we⁠—

Thomson. Is your name Feltmann or is it *not*?

Lingley. It is *not*.

Thomson. Very well then, your case is over. Get up.

Lingley. Wait. My name *is* Feltmann.

(Lingley *sits slowly.*)

Thomson. Why did you say it wasn’t?

Lingley. Business.

Thomson. Rascality.

Lingley (*rather truculent*). What am I charged with
            anyway?

Thomson. Just being yourself.

Lingley. I am very proud of being myself. From small
            beginnings I have worked up to great things. I have never hesitated for
            a second but always kept to the straight path. I am an honest British
            merchant⁠—my bank balance will show you that⁠—and that I have a career
            behind me any self-made man might be proud of. I await my just reward.

Thomson. You shall get it, honest British merchant. As a
            matter of fact you’re not British at all, Feltmann. You were born
            in Leipzig. You commenced your career by breaking a playmate’s head
            against a granite curb because he had a painted toy horse. You wanted
            to get it.

Lingley. Well, I got it.

Thomson. Oh, I’ll grant you that! That’s how you’ve made
            that glorious straight path you boast about. By knocking down anyone
            who came across it or tried to turn you off it. Well, you’ll have to
            *learn*, that’s all.

Lingley. I’ve not been wicked⁠—people respect me.

Thomson. Do they? To your face, perhaps. Come. (*Over to
            above table.*) Feltmann, you’re a business man. (*Sits.*) I’m
            ready to admit that. Some men get found out during their lives. You’re
            only found out now. Come off you get.

(Henry *and* Ann *appear at the centre door coming from left.
            They hesitate, looking in for a second, as if awaiting their turn
            then pass on right.* Duke *sees them.*)

Lingley. I⁠—I⁠—

Thomson. There is no appeal. You will suffer as you made
            others suffer. (*Pause.*)

(Thomson’s *manner is not hard and vindictive. He is kindly,
            tolerant and possibly even reluctant to dole out justice. But he is
            firm and just.*)

Lingley (*after a pause*). Give me a second chance.

Thomson. Did *you* give anybody a second chance? No, you
            must learn, my son. (*He turns and makes a note in his book.*)

(Lingley *looks defiantly for a moment at* Thomson, *whose
            back is turned, as if he’d like to strike him. This he attempts to
            do. But is suddenly stopped.*)

Thomson (*turning. Quietly*). That’s all.

(Lingley *slowly turns and goes out centre to left, utterly broken
            and dejected.*)

Duke. Thomson!

Thomson. Don’t look so shocked. It must be done. Suffering
            sometimes works wonderful transformations. Let’s hope, boy, let’s hope.
            Scrubby!

Scrubby. Sir.

Thomson (*to* Scrubby). Just see he goes the right way.

Scrubby. Very good, sir.

(*He follows* Lingley.)

Duke (*rises*). I wish you’d see the young couple next. I
            know *they* must be suffering.

Thomson. What young couple is this?

Duke. I told you about them.

Thomson. Yes, but I’ve had no information from any other
            quarter. It’s funny.

Duke. They seem so devoted. You’ll have a pleasant job with
            them, I know.

Thomson. But who exactly are they?

Duke. Well, I used to call them, to myself, “the lovers.”

(Scrubby *has appeared again in the centre.*)

Thomson. Steward, do you know anything about a young couple on
            this boat?

Scrubby. Oh, those two, sir! You wouldn’t want to see them.

Duke. Not see them?

Thomson. Why *shouldn’t* I want to see them?

Scrubby. They’re “half-ways” sir.

Thomson. Half-ways. Oh, that explains it. No, it wouldn’t be
            much use my seeing them. Show in⁠—Mrs. Cliveden-Banks.

Scrubby. Yes, sir. (*He goes out left.*)

Duke. You’re not even going to see them?

Thomson. I *can’t*, old boy.

Duke (*curiously*). What is a “half-way,” Thomson?

Thomson. You’ll learn, Duke, you’ll learn in good time.

(Scrubby *appears again announcing.*)

Duke. But I wish you would⁠—

Scrubby. Mrs. Cliveden-Banks!

(*She enters left and gushingly crosses to* Thomson. Scrubby
            *goes.*)

Mrs. C-Banks. How do you do? How *do* you do? *Very*
            pleased to meet you.

Thomson. Delighted to meet you, Mrs. Cliveden-Banks. Come and
            sit down.

Mrs. C-Banks. Thank you. Very sultry weather for the time of
            the year, isn’t it? Still, we’ve had a lovely passage, haven’t we,
            *dear* Mr. Duke?

Duke. Oh, yes, delightful, *dear* Mrs. Cliveden-Banks.

Mrs. C-Banks. It was a bit rough at first though, I must
            admit. Between ourselves, I was publicly ill on several occasions, but
            I didn’t mind. I love giving pleasure to others.

Thomson. I’m glad you enjoyed yourself.

Mrs. C-Banks. Oh, I did, I did. Thanks to your kind friend,
            Mr. Duke. We clung together like limpets. I really don’t know
            *what* I should have done without him. What wonderful men our
            church turns out, Mr.⁠—er⁠—

Thomson. Thomson, madam.

Mrs. C-Banks. No; surely not one of the *Berkshire*
            Thomsons?

Thomson. Not that I am aware of.

Mrs. C-Banks. Ah! a pity. My great-great-grandfather was a
            Berkshire Thomson.

Thomson. Really⁠—my great-great-grandfather was hanged for
            horse-thieving.

Mrs. C-Banks. How quaint.

Thomson. Mrs. Cliveden-Banks⁠—

Mrs. C-Banks. Do you play golf?

Thomson. I play indifferently.

Mrs. C-Banks. I think all men ought to play golf. It keeps
            them away from home such a lot. My husband, Colonel Cliveden-Banks, is
            quite an expert I believe.

Thomson. Oh, yes, Bunny’s hot stuff. I was having a round with
            him not long ago.

Mrs. C-Banks. I’m so glad to hear it. (*A pause, then
            suddenly.*) *What* did you say? You had a round with my husband
            not long ago?

Thomson. He was in terrific form after lunch.

Mrs. C-Banks (*alarmed*). When was this?

Thomson. Oh, about a week ago, I think.

Mrs. C-Banks. But I don’t understand. Is he *here*?

Thomson. He’s waiting for you. (*Rises.*) Yes, we had a
            great game. He’ll tell you all about it when you land.

Mrs. C-Banks. I *don’t land*!⁠—How did *he* get here?

Thomson. Poor old Bunny died a couple of months ago.

Mrs. C-Banks. How wicked of him. He might have let me know.

Thomson. Perhaps he didn’t think you’d care very much one way
            or the other.

Mrs. C-Banks. Why not? There was life insurance⁠—how like him,
            how very like him. Always self centred. Look at the passage money I’ve
            wasted! (*Suddenly.*) Benjamin and I are *both* dead then?
            (*She moves to chair left of table.*)

Thomson. Quite dead.

Mrs. C-Banks (*hopefully*). That makes the marriage null
            and void.

Thomson. Your marriage is only just beginning.

Mrs. C-Banks. How droll you are. But how nice of you to put it
            that way.

Thomson. Now will you go ashore. You’ll find everything
            most comfortable. A villa, servants, all you want⁠—and your husband
            waiting⁠—with outstretched arms.

Mrs. C-Banks. Yes, I can see him; exactly like a monkey.

Thomson. I hope you will be able to see his *heart*. I
            know it’s aching for you very badly.

Mrs. C-Banks. How ghastly.

Thomson. What’s the matter?

Mrs. C-Banks. What *right’s* he got to bob up again like
            this?

Thomson. Every right, and we’re very glad to have him here.
            Your husband is a very useful man.

Mrs. C-Banks. How well I know that phrase! It has always been
            used of Benjamin in every new office he’s undertaken, at the start.
            Later he invariably got the push.

(Henry *and* Ann *pass the centre door again during this
            speech, look anxiously in and then pass on left.*)

Thomson. And do you know why? Because of his wife’s malicious
            tongue.

Mrs. C-Banks (*rises, crosses to left*). How dare you?
            I’m sure I’ve never said anything nasty about anyone⁠—except when
            it was for their good. I’ve certainly never said anything bad about
            Benjamin. I don’t know that I’ve said anything good about him, because
            there’s nothing good *to* say about him. (*Sits.*)

Thomson. There is a very great deal of good in Bunny. But
            it was always stifled back by you. He was a staunch, a devoted
            husband⁠—look what he gave *you*⁠—and what did you give in return?
            Nothing!

Mrs. C-Banks. But I haven’t seen him for years.

Thomson. It was *your* neglect⁠—not his.

Mrs. C-Banks. Oh, but he looks so funny.

Thomson. The only funny thing about him is that he wants to
            see you. Why he should *want* to see you is beyond me. But he
            does, and he’s going to.

Mrs. C-Banks. And what shall I be exactly?

Thomson. You’ll be his wife; and in time you will learn to be
            a *good* wife.

Mrs. C-Banks. I refuse absolutely.

Thomson. You *can’t* refuse. (*With finality.*)

(*A long pause.*)

Mrs. C-Banks. I won’t do it! I won’t, I won’t.

Duke. Why won’t you, Mrs. Cliveden-Banks?

Mrs. C-Banks. *He* knows⁠—ask him. (*Indicating*
            Thomson.)

Duke. Mr. Thomson⁠—?

(Thomson *is silent, waiting.*)

Mrs. C-Banks (*to* Thomson). You know as well as I do,
            it’s his eyes. The look in his eyes. You know I couldn’t face them any
            more⁠—

Thomson. Yes;⁠—you never could look him in the eyes. You’re a
            thoroughly bad lot. You trapped him; you were grasping, you made him
            marry you. You⁠—you⁠—you⁠—

Mrs. C-Banks. Don’t let me down before *him*.
            (*Indicating* Duke.)

Thomson. I wouldn’t if you’d been a *good* harlot, but
            you weren’t, you were a bad one.

Mrs. C-Banks. (*Pause.*) Rather a vulgar way of putting
            it! Anyway I was nothing of the sort.

Duke. She always said she was a soldier’s daughter.

Mrs. C-Banks. And so I *am*!⁠—I’m the daughter of a
            lance-corporal. And mother never even knew his regiment. Is that frank
            enough for you, Mr. Duke?

Duke. Dear, dear, only a poor unfortunate after all.

Thomson. No, Duke, *not* a poor unfortunate. This old
            woman was once a beautiful young girl, outwardly, but she was never an
            unfortunate, never. She’s been just a schemer. And somehow she’s always
            managed to fall on her feet. There were two other men before she met
            Cliveden-Banks, richer men too than he was then. But she saw something
            *steady* in Bunny, so she made him marry her. He found out all
            about it later⁠—and he’s never told her. Too unselfish⁠—too “big”⁠—too
            loyal.⁠—So she goes back to him. I hope he *beats* her⁠—but I know
            he won’t. Anyway, she’ll get her punishment. The eyes that made her run
            away.⁠—Only remember, Mrs. Cliveden-Banks, it won’t be Bunny who’ll
            know now, it will be you and I and everybody *except* Bunny. He’ll
            have forgotten. (*Over to left of table.*)

Mrs. C-Banks. Um! Now let me see. A villa⁠—servants. And you
            really think Benjamin would idealise me? Oh well, I suppose it might be
            worse, I’ll go. (*Rises, crosses to centre.*)

Thomson. Of *course* you will.

Mrs. C-Banks. For his sake, yes. I see it’s my duty to. Ah,
            duty, duty, such a compelling thing. Speaking of duties, there are no
            *customs*, I suppose? No. Good. Perhaps you’ll both come and dine
            with the Colonel and me⁠—one night. Goodbye, Mr⁠—(*Moves up centre to
            door*)⁠—er⁠—Tomkins. (*Pause.*) You swine.

(*She goes out right.*)

Thomson. Phew! this place wants fumigating. (Henry *and*
            Ann *appear from left and pause anxiously.* Henry *catches*
            Duke’s *eye and his appealing look is understood by* Duke. Duke
            *attracts* Thomson’s *attention to them.*) Eh? (*Turns and
            looks toward* Henry *and* Ann⁠—*then back to* Duke.) Is
            this the⁠—er⁠—couple?

Duke (*nods “Yes”*). Can’t you⁠—?

Thomson (*to* Henry *and* Ann). (*Shaking his head
            benignly.*) Not *yet*, my children.

(Henry *and* Ann *retire centre.*)

Duke (*after watching them off curiously, turns to*
            Thomson). Thomson⁠—what *are* “half-ways”?

(*Before* Thomson *can reply* Prior *enters left
            excitedly.*)

Tom. Duke⁠—Duke!

Duke. Yes. (*Cross left.*)

Tom. Make him see *me* next.

Duke. Really, Prior⁠—

Tom. You must, I can’t stand the suspense. My nerves aren’t
            right⁠—and I can’t stand it.

Duke. There’s nothing to worry about.

Tom (*shouts*). I tell you I can’t stand it. I want to be
            put out.

Thomson (*turning and coming down*). What’s the matter,
            boy?

Tom. Oh, sir, if you please, I want you to deal with me next.
            It isn’t fair treating me like the others⁠—I’m very highly strung.

Thomson. Come in, boy, come in and don’t be frightened.
            (*Passes* Tom *to chair left of table.*) We’re not going to
            hurt you. (*Leading him over.*) There, sit down there. Now what’s
            the trouble?

Tom. I want to be dealt with, sir. I want to *know*.

Thomson. Calm yourself, boy, calm yourself. (*Giving him
            glass.*) Drink this. You’re fond of your drink, I know.

Tom. Thanks, sir. (*Drinks and then holds out glass
            again.*)

Thomson. Well, what do you want? (*Goes right of table and
            sits.*)

Tom. I want to be killed⁠—I want to be killed.

Thomson. Um! Healthy outlook you’ve got, haven’t you?

Tom. No, I haven’t. I’m a weak character. I want to be let off
            lightly. I want to be hit over the head with a stone and finished.

Thomson (*rises*). Duke, send ashore for a bag of stones,
            will you?

Tom. Oh, don’t joke! I’ll drop all sarcasm⁠—it’s the only
            thing that kept me going up till now⁠—but I’ll drop it now if you will.

Thomson. Certainly. (*Sits right of table.*)

Tom. I know⁠—at least I guess what you’re doing with the
            others. You’re keeping them going, keeping them going with punishment
            and promises and things. Well, *I* don’t want to be kept going. I
            want blank.

Thomson. Impossible.

Tom. But I’m dead. (*Rise.*) And I demand the right to be
            properly dead. I’ve always dreamt about being dead⁠—when I’ve slept at
            all.

Thomson. How old are you?

Tom (*sits*). Oh, hundreds of years⁠—I must be. Give me
            blank.

Thomson. You’re going on like the others. You’ve got to.

Tom. I won’t, I won’t!

Thomson. You’ll find it quite easy to forget here, you know.

Tom. Easy to forget what? You’re not suggesting I’m to go on,
            and without *this*? (*The glass.*)

(Mrs. Midget *appears left.*)

Thomson. Yes.

Tom. Is that all I’m to forget?

Thomson. Yes.

Tom. As if I could! As if I would anyway. You damned torturer.
            I see what you want me to do. You want me to chuck drink, develop a
            nice clean brain and remember all the other horrors! No, I won’t do it.
            It’s all I’ve got, it’s my only comfort and if I’m to go on I won’t
            give it up. See? But I’m not going to go on. Kill me! There, it’s not
            asking much. And look at all the trouble it will spare you. I’m not
            worth saving. I’m not really.

Thomson. You’ve suffered.

Tom. Ha! (*As if to say* “Haven’t I?”)

Thomson. Can’t I do *anything*?

Tom. No, you can’t. (*Rises and goes up centre.*)

Mrs. Midget (*quietly from the back*). Perhaps *I*
            could, sir.

Thomson (*facing sharply*). What do you want?

Mrs. Midget. My name’s Midget, sir. Excuse me bargein’ in as
            it were, but⁠—

Thomson. I’m very pleased to meet you⁠—yes, yes, I know all
            about you. But you’ve no business here yet.

Mrs. Midget. Oh, but I *have*. You see, yer reverence,
            when I first got on to this big boat nobody would speak to me. I was
            lost as it were⁠—was⁠—and then young Mr. Prior was very kind to me.
            *’E* spoke to me and broke the icicles, as is said, and if he
            is in trouble I really don’t feel I could put my ’ead on my pillow
            to-night⁠—if I ’ave one⁠—after what ’e done for me. (*Goes to*
            Tom, *touches him.*) Now what is all this fluster and to do,
            anyway? It’s about the booze, ain’t it?

Tom. Booze⁠—eh? Oh, well⁠—yes⁠—drink *is* certainly mixed
            up with it.

Mrs. Midget. Nasty ’orrid stuff.

Tom. Beautiful stuff, Mrs. Midget.

Mrs. Midget. Mind you I don’t say there’s any ’arm in a man
            ’aving’ ’is beer if he wants ’is beer, but the man I does object to is
            the man who’s *always* wanting it. I shouldn’t think you’ve ever
            ’ad much of a *chance*, though, ’ave you, sir?

Tom. I’ve had every chance, Mrs. Midget. I was spoilt. I was
            ungrateful. I ruined⁠—Please drop it.

Mrs. Midget (*pause*). There was a girl, too, wasn’t
            there?

Tom. Be quiet!

Mrs. Midget (*another pause*). There *was* a girl,
            though, wasn’t there?

Tom. Oh yes, there was. How did you know?

Mrs. Midget. She was the final old ’ow do you do, I take it?

Tom. As you so poetically express it, she *was*.

(Henry *and* Ann *appear at door centre and unseen by the
            others stand listening apprehensively.*)

Mrs. Midget. She chucked you, didn’t she? But you’ll be
            different now, I know something about girls and⁠—your reverence
            (*behind* Tom *to* Thomson), I daresay this particular one
            might come along here some day?

Thomson. It’s quite possible. But it doesn’t always follow,
            Mrs. Midget, that just because a boy and girl are sweethearts, they
            may always go on together here. On the contrary, they’re sometimes
            *separated*⁠—so much depends⁠—so much depends.

(Ann *utters a faint wail and* Henry *leads her further back
            into the shadows up left where they remain enviously watching the
            rest of the scene.* Mrs. Midget *looks sympathetically at*
            Henry *and* Ann; *then resumes to* Tom.)

Mrs. Midget. What a triumph it would be for you if *your*
            girl suddenly appeared ’ere and found you, mind yer it *might*
            ’appen, settled down and smart and respectable like, with a good job
            and a decent salary reg’lar every Saturday. (*To* Thomson.) I
            suppose you’ve got jobs ’ere, ’aven’t you?

Thomson. Plenty.

Mrs. Midget. Now what you want is a nice, good, honest, steady
            respectable housekeeper who’d take care of you.

Tom (*annoyed*). Mrs. Midget⁠—!

Mrs. Midget. Yes, *she* might do. Then all your things
            would be properly looked after. With everything mended and darned ready
            for yer to put on. Someone to see yer didn’t sit up too late, too
            often. No fussing mind, and call you in the morning with a nice ’ot cup
            of tea. What time do you get up?

Tom. Oh, don’t!

Mrs. Midget. Oh you can ’ave your drinks, as long as you don’t
            let them interfere with your meals or take away your appetite. I’m a
            good cook I am, and if you left anything untouched it would upset me
            awful.

Thomson. Mrs. Midget, you’re suggesting.

Mrs. Midget. I was *thinking* of it, yes.

Thomson. Very fine, very fine of you. There’s a little cottage
            waiting for you, with a garden by the sea.

Mrs. Midget (*enthusiastic*). There we *are* then!
            The very spot. (*Sudden change to the practical.*) ’As it got a
            good sink?

Thomson. You don’t quite follow. True, Mr. Prior is free to do
            as he chooses but he has not yet arrived on the same plane as you have.
            He would not be allowed to live there to begin with anyway.

Mrs. Midget. Then why can’t I go where *he’s* going?
            That’s simple enough.

Thomson. It would mean going back to the *slums*.

Mrs. Midget. And what’s the matter with the slums. They’re all
            right.

Tom. I won’t listen to the idea.

Mrs. Midget (*pleading*). You can always give me a week’s
            notice.

Tom. I’m not worth bothering about.

Mrs. Midget. I’m willing to ’ave a shot.

Tom. I can’t understand this extraordinary interest anyway.

Mrs. Midget. One good turn deserves another. Sir, wouldn’t the
            people who spoilt you be glad if they knew you was in capable ’ands?

Tom. They would be, I suppose.

Mrs. Midget. *And* doing well? (*With growing
            fervour.*)

Tom. Er⁠—yes⁠—of course.

Mrs. Midget. That might ease those ’orrid thoughts of yours a
            bit too, mightn’t it?

Tom. It might.

Mrs. Midget. Well then, ain’t it worth it?

Tom. This is another trap.

Mrs. Midget. Velvet-lined, sir.

Tom. Please don’t keep on calling me “sir,” I’m not a
            gentleman really.

Mrs. Midget. Aren’t you, sir?

Tom. No, I’m not. If I were, I shouldn’t be hesitating as I
            am. Mr. Examiner, help me. *You* must be experienced in making
            decisions.

Thomson. No, boy, I can’t help you in this. It’s your own
            choice.

Tom. Duke, I⁠—

Duke. You know what Mr. Thomson said, it’s for you to speak.

Tom. Very well then. (*Pause.*) I’ll go. (*Rising and
            going up centre. Another pause.*) By myself!

Duke. Prior!

Tom. *I’m not worth bothering about.*

Thomson. And in those very words you’ve proved you are!
            Because you really meant ’em. Humility, my boy, humility! Take him
            away, Mrs. What’s⁠—er⁠—name and do the best you can with him. And jolly
            good luck to you both, you couple of rascals.

Tom. Mind you I won’t promise⁠—I won’t promise to be good.

Mrs. Midget. No, sir, we’ll just ’ope⁠—mutual like.

Tom (*fingering his glass*). It’s going to be
            difficult⁠—yes, it’s going to be difficult.

Thomson. *That’s* the way.

Tom. Thanks awfully. (*Sets down glass.*) And I will try.

(*He goes out on to the deck and off right.* Mrs. Midget
            *overjoyed starts to follow him.*)

Thomson. Good day, Mrs. Prior⁠—you’re a good mother.

Mrs. Midget (*turning on* Thomson *ferociously*).
            Blast you, how did you find out. Blast you! (*Then suddenly changing
            to pleading pitifully.*) You’ll never tell ’im, will you? Promise
            you’ll never let him know.

Thomson. I promise.

Mrs. Midget (*going to* Duke *and clutching him*).
            And you too, sir?

Duke. I promise, of course.

Mrs. Midget (*turning back*). Thank you, both. You see
            he mustn’t even guess. Oh, sirs, ain’t it wonderful? He doesn’t know
            me, and I’ve got him to look after at last⁠—Without any fear of me
            disgracing him, it’s ’Eaven, that’s what it is, it’s ’Eaven!

Tom (*off*). Mrs. Midget.

Mrs. Midget. He wants me at last⁠—yes dearie, I’m coming.
            (*She goes out centre in ecstacy, and off right.*)

(Thomson *with a pleased chuckle stands left of door with his back
            to* Henry *and* Ann, *watching her out.* Duke *stands
            further down right.* Henry *and* Ann *drop down to extreme
            left.*)

Thomson (*after a pause*). Come along, Duke. (*He comes
            down a bit, takes* Duke *by the arm in a most fraternal way and
            without looking back goes out centre and off right.*)

(Duke *follows but hesitates at door a moment and looks back
            at* Henry *and* Ann, *who stand mystified and fearful.*
            Henry *makes a slight but frantic gesture of appeal to* Duke
            *as if to say “But what about us?”* Duke *looks at them
            sympathetically, but shrugs his shoulders helplessly.* Duke
            *follows and disappears.* Henry *and* Ann *stand hopeless
            and bewildered, they look from one to the other curiously; then she,
            terror-stricken in awful apprehension of the uncertainty of their
            plight, at their being ignored, at the mystery of it all, suddenly
            clutches* Henry’s *arm and holds to him tightly.*)

Curtain.
