### Of the CAUSES of Tasts.

![T](images/i_drop_t_148.jpg)
O
 speak of the *Causes* of *Tasts*, before we have
well enumerated and distinguished them; is to
provide *Furniture* for a *House*, before the *Roomes*
have been counted and measured out. But the
*Varieties* of *Tasts* having been first laid down;
it will induce us to believe, and investigate as
great a variety in their *Causes*.

2. §. Now the *Causes* of *Tasts*, particularly
of the *Tasts* of *Plants*, whereof we chiefly
speak, are, in general, these Four or Five, *sc.* The *Bed* out of which they
grow; The *Aer* in which they stand; The *Parts* of which they consist;
The several *Fermentations* under which their *Juyces* pass; And the *Organs*
by which their *Tastable Parts* are perceiv’d: as will appear upon
*Instance*.

3. §. But the immediate *Causes*, besides the *Organs* of *Taste*, are
the *Principles* of *Plants*. As many of which, as come under the notice
of *Sense*, we have already supposed to be these Seven, *Alkaline*, *Acid*,
*Aer*, *Water*, *Oyl*, *Spirit* and *Earth*. The *Particles* both of *Alkaline* and
*Acid Salts*, are all *angular* and *poynted*. Those of *Aer*, properly and
strictly so called, are *Elastick* or *Springy*; and therefore also *Crooked*; as
I have likewise formerly conjectured. And I find the Learned *Borelli*,
in a Book of his since then published, to be of the same Opinion. Those
of all *Fluid Bodies*, *quà Fluid*, and therefore of *Water*, *Oyl* and *Spirit*,
I conceive to be *Globular*, but *hollow*, and with holes in their Sides.
Those of *Water*, to be larger *Globes*, with more *holes*; those of *Oyl*, to
be lesser, with fewer *holes*; and those of *Spirit* the least. Lastly, that
the particles of *Earth* are also *Round*; yet angular; and nearer to a
*solid*.

4. §. These *Principles* affect the *Organs* of *Sense*, according to the
variety of their *Figures*, and of their *Mixture*. So those which are
sharp or poynted; and those which are *springy*; are fitted to produce
any stronger *Taste*: and those which are round, are apt, of their
own *Nature*, to produce a *weaker* or *softer* one. And so by the diversities
of their *Mixture*; not only with respect to their *Proportion*,
but also the very *Mode* of their *Conjunction*. Hence it is, that many
*Bodies* which abound with *Salt*, as *Ambar* with an *Acid*, and the *Bones*
of *Land-Animals* with an *Alkaline*, have notwithstanding but a weak
*Tast*; the *Saline Parts* being in the former drowned in the *Oyl*, and in
the latter also buried in the *Earth*.

5. §. The same is further confirmed by an *Experiment* mentioned
in a former *Discourse*;
 Of *Mixt.* Ch. 5. *sc.* the *Transmutation* of *Oyl* of *Anise-Seeds*,
with the help of *Oyl* of *Vitriol*, into a *Rosin*. For both those *Liquors*,
though so strongly tasted, apart; yet the *Rosin* made of them, being
well washed, hath a very mild *Taste*, and without any smatch of that

in either of the *Liquors*. Whence it follows, that the very *Mode* of
*Mixture* is sufficient, not only for the variation of the *Degrees* in any
one *Species* of *Tast*; but also for the destroying of one *Species*, and the
introducing of another.

6. §. THESE things being premised, I conceive, That as an *Unctuous
Tast* dependeth upon *Oyl*; so a *Vapid* either on *Water*, or *Earth*: or
upon such an intimate *Mixture* of other *Principles*, as renders them indissoluble
by the *Saliva*, and so, in a manner, untastable.

7. §. That a *Pungent*, is made either by an *Alkaly* or an *Acid*
sharpned or whetted; that is, cleared from the soyl of other *Principles*;
as in the *Spirit* of *Sal Armoniac* or of *Sulphur*. And so in those
*Plants* which have a *Pungent Tast*; whose *Juyces* or *Tinctures*, although
they consist of divers *Principles*, yet all so loosely mixed, that being
dissolved by the *Saliva*, the *Saline* are hereupon left naked. Wherefore
*biting Plants*, *qua biting*, are *Nitrous Plants*. So that the *Juyce*
of such *Plants*, is a kind of *Spirit* of *Nitre*, made by the several *Parts*
of the *Plant*. Hence *Arum* grows best under an Hedg; where the
Ground, not being exposed to the *Sun*, but the *Aer* only, like those
*Rooms* in *Houses*, which are covered, is impregnated with a greater quantity
of *Nitrous Salt*. And those *Roots* which are *Biting*, have but few
or but small *Aer-Vessels*; whereby fewer parts of the *nitroaereal Sap* are
carryed off into the *Trunk*. For the same *Cause*, it is no wonder,
that many *Aquaticks* are *Biting*; *Water* being, though it self cold, yet
the *Menstruum* by which all *Salts* are imbibed most easily, and in laxer
state of *Commixture* with other *Principles*.

8. §. *Penetrant* (something slower than *Pungent*) is made by any
*Salt* that is also soiled or guarded with *Earth*. *Sower*, by an *Acid* only
soyled with *Earth*. *Salt*, by an *Acid* guarded by an *Alkaly*, and soyled
with *Earth*. *Cold*, by an *Acid* drowned in *Water*, and soyled with
*Earth*.

9. §. In all these, the *Salts* are *predominant*; In *Heat* the *Oyl* or
*Sulphur*. The particles whereof being *Spherick* and *bored* with *holes*;
those of *Salt* stick in them, as the *Spokes* do in the *Hub* of a *Wheel*, or
as the *Quills* in the *Skin* of a *Porcupine*. Whereby, as in *Common Fire*
the *Sparks* of *Sulphur* being agitated and whirled about by the *Aer*;
with the help of the *Salts*, which stick in them, tear in pieces all kinds
of *Bodies*: so here, being agitated by the *Circulation* of the *Blood*, they
make a kind of hurry or combustion; and so, according to the degree
and strength of their *Motion*, tear in pieces fewer or more of the *Fibers*
of the *Tongue*; and in a greater quantity, would raise a *Blister*
upon it; the common *Effect* of *Fire*, or any strong *Epispastick*. So that
a *Hot Tast*, is produced by *Sulphur* toothed or armed with *Salts*.
Wherefore all *Stillatitious Oyls* are *Hot*; being strongly impregnated
or armed with the *Essential Salts* of the *Plants* from whence they are
distilled. And as those *Plants* which are very *Parenchymous*, from the
predominancy of their *Volatile Acid*, are *biting*: So those which are
*Lignous*, that is, have a good quantity of *Lympheducts*, from the dominion
of their *Sulphur* are commonly *Hot*. For the same reason
it is, that many both *Biting* and *Hot Plants*, as the *Roots* of *Dragon*,
*Garden-Radish*, *Onion*, *Iris*, *Rape-Crowfoot*, &c. being corked up in a
bottle with *Water*, and set in a Cellar or other cool place; they do all
of them turn *Sower* in a few days: The same *Fermentation*, at once

sullying the *Salts* of the one, and disarming the *Sulphurs* of the other.
But some, wherein the *Sulphureous* parts are more copious, will hardly
ever become *Sower*. Hence also, some *Plants*, whose *Roots* are neither
*Hot*, nor of any strong *Taste*, as those of *Wild Anemone*; yet their
*Leaves* and *Flowers* are plainly *Caustick*: So that it seems, that as their
*Juyces* rise up into the *Trunk* or *Stalk*, and are therein further fermented,
the *Sulphurous Parts* thereof, are at the same time relaxed from the
other *Principles*, and acuated with an *Aereal Salt*.

10. §. A *Stupifacient Tast* (as the *Impression* which some *Hot Plants*
make upon the *Tongue* may be called) is in some sort, analogous to the
mortifying of any part of the Body by the application of a *Caustick*.
For as there the mortification succeeds the burning pain, so here, the
*Stupifaction*, neither comes before, nor with the *Heat*, but follows it.

11. §. *Sweetness* is produced, sometimes by an *Alkaly*; smoothed
either by a *Sulphur*, as in *Lime-Water*; or by both a *Spirit* and a *Sulphur*,
as in the *Stillatitious Oyls* of *Animals*. But most commonly, by
a smoothed *Acid*; as in *Malt*, *Sugar*, *Hony*. Hence a *Sweet Taste*, is
generally founded in a Sower; So Sower *Apples*, by mellowing, and
harsh *Pears*, by baking become sweet; the *Spirit* and *Sulphur* being
hereby at once separated from the other *Principles* and brought to a
nearer union with the *Acid*. So the Sower *Leaves* of *Wood-Sorrel*, being
dry’d, become sweet: and those of a sower *Codlin*, while they
hang on the *Tree*, and even of a *Crab-Tree*, are neither *Astringent*, nor
sower, but sensibly sweet. And so commonly, wherever the said *Principles*
are a little exalted by a soft *Fermentation*; as in the *Juyce* of the
*Stalk* of *Maze* or *Indian Wheat*, which is as sweet as *Sugar*; and in the
*green Stalks* of all sorts of *Corn* and *Grass*, in several degrees. So likewise
*Tulips* and some other *Roots*, being taken up, in open weather,
sometime before they *sprout*; if tasted, are as sweet as *Liquirish* or *Sugar*;
and at no other time: not only *Fruits*, but many *Roots*, *Seeds*,
and other *Parts*, upon their first or early *Germination*, acquiring a curious
*Mellowness*, wherein, all their *Principles* are resolved, and their
most *Spirituous Parts* exalted and spread over the *Acid*. Wherefore
also most *Roots*, which are not meerly long, but grow deep in the
ground, have at least some of their *Juyces* of a sweet *Tast*; as *Liquirish*,
*Eryngo*, *Hounds-Tongue*, *Garden-Parsnep*, *Black Henbeane*, *Deadly Night-shade*,
*&c.* Even the *Juyce* of *Horse Radish*, which bleeds at the *Lympheducts*,
is of a sweet *Taste*. And of the same kindred those which
grow the deepest, are the sweetest; as a *Parsnep* is sweeter than a *Carrot*,
especially if you tast the bleeding *Sap*; and the *Root* of *Common
Tall Trefoyl* tasteth somewhat like *Liquirish*, but is not near so sweet.
For all deep *Roots*, are fed with a less *Nitrous Aliment*: and being remoter
from the *Aer*, their *Juyces* pass under much more soft and moderate
*Fermentations*.

12. §. *Bitterness* is produced by a *Sulphur* well impregnated, either
with an *Alkaline*, or an *Acid Salt*, but also shackled with *Earth*. And
therefore the *Bitterest Plants*, commonly yield the greatest quantity of
*Lixivial Salt*. So also many *Stillatitious Oyls* digested with any strong
*Acid*, will acquire a *Bitter Taste*. Wherefore this *Taste* is often founded
either in a *Hot Taste*, or a *Sweet*. Hence it is, that the *Leaves* of all
sweet *Roots* are *Bitter*. And that the *Fig-Tree*, which bears a sweet
*Fruit*, bleeds a *Bitter Milk*. So likewise those *Plants*, which bear a

*Bitter Stalk*, have not *Bitter*, but *Hot Roots*, as in *Yarrow*, *Primrose*,
*Wormwood*, *Rue*, *Carduus benedictus* &c. is manifest. So the *Coats* of
the *Seeds* of *Viola Lunaria* are of a *hot* and *biting Tast*; but the *Seeds*
themselves, in which the *Salts*, though copious, yet are also immersed
in a greater quantity of *Oyl*, are *Bitter*. And that the *Earthy Parts* do
also contribute something more to this, than to most of the forementioned
*Tasts*, is argued from its being more *Fixed*; that is, the *Body* in which
it resides, is either more *Fixed*, or else flyeth not away in that same
state of conjunction, by which it maketh a *Bitter Taste*. For whereas
*Hot*, *Biting*, and divers other *Plants* lose the strength of their *Taste*,
by drying; most of those which are *Bitter*, do hereby increase it. And
although the *Extract* of *Dandelion* and some other *Roots*, which are
very *Bitter*, hath scarce any *Tast*, yet generally, they are *Bitter Plants*,
which are best for the making of *Extracts*. And the distilled waters
of *Plants* which are *Hot* and **Bitter**, notwithstanding that they always
tast high of the *Heat*, yet rarely and very faintly of the *Bitter*.

13. §. *Astringency*, is made, partly, by the further increase and
more intimate union of the *Earth*. And therefore this is seated still in
a more *Fixed Composition*, than a *Bitter*. And partly, by the diminution
of the *Sulphur*. And therefore the *Acid Parts* ingredient to it,
either by *Fermentation* or otherwise, are easily exposed. *Astringency*
being the *Womb* or *Bud* of a *Sower*. For all or most *Astringent Roots*
bear a sower *Leaf*, or a sower *Fruit*; as those of all *Docks* and *Sorrels*,
*Black-Thorn*, *Dog-Rose*, and others. Wherefore also, *Astringency* is
often found in conjunction with *Bitter*, *Sweet*, or *Sower*; but scarce
ever with *Pungent*, or *Hot*.

14. §. An *Aromatick Tast*, seems to be produced, chiefly, by a
*spirituous*, *acid*, and *volatile Sulphur*; as in *Ambar-griese*, *Cardamon-Seeds*,
many *Stillatitious Oyls* &c. A *Nauseous*, by a *Sulphur* less *Spirituous*
and *Volatile*, and more *Alkaline*; as in the *Root* of *Dog-stones*, *Sheep scabious*,
the young and green *Leaves* of *Coriander*, or the *Seeds* of *Cumine*.
The *Spirit*, as it enters the *Nerves*, carrying the *Alkaline Sulphur*
along with it; as when a City is betrayed by one of its Inhabitants to
an Enemy.

15. §. An *Intermittent Taste*, as in *Arum*, seems to have its dependance
upon a simple and very pure *Nitre*, which by its subtilty enters
into the very *Concaves* of the *Nervous Fibers* of the *Tongue*: and so
being lodged there, is little affected or stirred, by the *Motion* of the
*Blood*; but only when the *Tongue* it self is moved, at which time it
causeth a kind of pricking *Taste*.

16. §. A *Tremulous Taste*, as in *Pyrethrum*, dependeth probably,
upon an *Aereal Sulphur*; which being agitated by the *Blood* in its *Circulation*,
the *springy Motion* or *Vibration* of the *Aereal Parts* produce
that *Taste*.

17. §. A *Tast* is *Lingual*, *Guttural*, &c. according to the grosness
or fineness or other difference of the *Membranes* into which the *tastable
parts* are admitted. For *Tasts* are made not meerly by the outward
*Contact*, but the *Ingress* of the *tastable parts*. Now the outer *Skin* of
the *Tongue*, which is commonly observed to pill off in boyling, like the
*Cuticula* in other *Parts*, hath either no sense, or much less than that which
lies under it; and is therefore, but a *Sieve* or *Strainer* to the *tastable
parts*. So that being of different fineness in the several parts of the

*Tongue*; it hereby comes to pass, that according as the *tastable parts* of
any *Plant* are more or less penetrant, subtle, or dissoluble, they are
admitted into one part of the *Tongue*, and not another. And in the
*Throat*, the outer *Skin* it self, seems to be the immediate *Sensory*; and
so, to be evidently affected with the *Juyces* of some *Plants*, from which
the *Tongue* receiveth little or no sensible *Impression*.

18. §. When the *Tast* is *Permanent* and *Fixed* in some one *Part*;
it is a sign, either that the *Gustable Parts* are less dissoluble; or more
subtle, so as to enter the *Concaves* of the *Fibers*; and that there is an
admixture of an *Aereal Salt*, or a like *Sulphur*; some of the parts whereof,
being crooked, hang like *Hooks* on the *Fibers* of the *Tongue*. For
the reception of such a *Tast*, is not to be looked upon as a wound
made with a *Lancet*, and so the *Lancet* taken away; but with the *Lancet*
sticking in the wound; until in time, ’tis carryed off by the *Circulation*
of the *Blood*; which like the *Stream* of a *River* in a *Flood*,
carries all before it, but those things last, which stick in the *Mud*.

19. §. But when the *Tast*, though *Permanent*, yet is *Diffusive* or
*Transitive*; it seems probable, that as there is a less admixture of *Aer*;
so a greater subtlety of the *Tastable Parts*, whereby they are conveyed,
through the *Nervous Fibers*, from one *Part* to another.
