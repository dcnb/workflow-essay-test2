### Of the EMPALEMENT.

NEXT proceed to the *Flower*. Where I intend
not to repeat those things, which have been by Me
already noted in the *First* **Book**.
 *Ch. 5.* And the foregoing
Discourse of *Leaves*, will excuse me from divers
particulars, common to *These* and the *Flower*.
I shall here therefore remarque some things not before
mentioned, or but *in transitu*, and such as
are more particular to the *Flower*.

2. §. And First, it may be noted; That where the *Leaves* of the
*Flower* are few; those of the *Empalement* or *Green Border*, are either
of the same Number, or just half as many, whether even, or odd. So
in *Leucanthenum* and *Chickweed*, there are Five *Leaves*; in the former
Five *Empalers*; in the latter, Ten. In Great *Celandine*, there are
Four *Leaves*, and but Two *Empalers*; and so in *Poppy*. The *Arithmetick*
of *Nature* being every where suitable to Her *Geometry*.

3. §. Of this *Part* of the *Flower* it is likewise observable, That
it is rarely, if ever, entire or one piece, but parted into divers little
*Leafy Pales*, especially in all *Flowers* with the *Florid Attire*, as of *Marigold*,
*Daisy* and the like; being so numerous, as to make a *Double*, and
often a *Treble*, *Quadruple* or *Quintuple Border*. Whereby they are aptly
designed, not only to *protect* the *Leaves* of the *Flower* in the *Bud*;
and after their Expansion, to keep them tite: but also, by receding,
*Bredthways*, one from another, and so making a greater *Circle*, gradually
to give way for the full Growth and safe spreading of the *Attire*.
Which, in regard it consists of *Parts* so exquisitely tender, were

it pinched up too close, would be killed or spoyled before it came to
the *Birth*. As *Teeming Women*, gradually slaken their *Laces*; or as
*Taylors* use to split their *Stomachers* into several *Lappets*, to spread, as
their *Belly* rises.

4. §. Nor is the *Posture* of the *Parts* in the *Empalement* less suitable:
not being filed one just over another, but alternately. Whereby
the *Pales* or *Pannicles* of every *Under-Order*, serve to stop up the gaps
made by the *Recess* of the *Upper*. And so, notwithstanding they all
make more roome, yet all conspire to keep the *Aer* out.

5. §. It is also worth the notice, That, for the same purpose, the
Edges at least, of the several *Pales*, are neither *Fibrous*, nor *Pulpy*; but
so many extream fine transparent *Skins*, as in *Chamemile*. Whereby
they close so exactly one over another, that it is impossible for any *Aer*
to creep in, or any *Steams* useful to the *Attire* or *Seed*, over hastily to
perspire. As we use, when we have put a *Cork* into a *Bottle*, to tie a
*Bladder* over it.
