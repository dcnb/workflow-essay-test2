### Of the TRUNK.

AVING
 thus declar’d the degrees of *Vegetation*
in the *Root*; the continuance hereof in the *Trunk*
shall next be shew’d: in order to which, the
Parts whereof this likewise is compounded, we
shall first observe.

1. §. That which without dissection shews it
self, is the *Coarcture*: I cannot say of the *Root*,
nor of the *Trunk*; but what I choose here to mention, as standing
betwixt them, and so being common to them both; all their *Parts*
being here bound in closer together, as in the tops of the grown *Roots*
of very many *Plants*, is apparent.

2. §. Of the *Parts* of the *Trunk*, the first occurring is its *Skin*:
The Formation whereof, is not from the Air, but in the *Seed*, from
whence it is originated; being the production of the *Cuticle*, there
investing the two *Lobes* and *Plume*.

3. §. The next *Part* is the *Cortical Body*; which here in the
*Trunk* is no new substantial Formation; but, as is that of the *Root*,
originated from the *Parenchyma* of the *Plume* in the *Seed*; and is only
the increase and augmentation thereof. *Tab. 3. f. 1, & 4.*  The *Skin*, this *Cortical Body*
or *Parenchyma*, and (for the most part) some Fibers of the *Lignous*
mixed herewith, altogether make the *Barque*.

4. §. Next, the *Lignous Body*, which, whether it be visibly divided
into many softer *Fibers* or small *Threads*, as in the *Bean*, *Fennel*,
and most *Herbs*; *Tab. 3. f. 1.*  or that its Parts stand more compact and close,
shewing one hard, firm and solid piece, as in *Trees*; it is, in all, one
and the same *Body*; and that not formed originally in the *Trunk*,
but in the *Seed*; being nothing else but the prolongation of the *Seminal
Root* distributed in the *Lobes* and *Plume* thereof.

5. §. Lastly, The *Insertions* and *Pith* are here originated likewise
from the *Plume*, as the same in the *Root*, from the *Radicle*: So
that as to their *Substantial Parts*, the *Lobes* of the *Seed*, the *Radicle*
and *Plume*, the *Root* and *Trunk* are all one.

6. §. Yet some things are more fairly observable in the *Trunk*.
First, the *Latitudinal* shootings of the *Lignous Body*, which in *Trunks*
of several years growth, are apparent in so many *Rings*, as is commonly
known. For several young Fibers of the *Lignous Body*, *Tab. 3. f. 5, & 8.*  as in the
*Root*, so here, shooting in the *Cortical* one year, and the spaces betwixt
them being after fill’d up with more (I think not till) the
next, at length they become altogether a firm compact *Ring*; the
*Perfection* of one *Ring*, and the *Ground-work* of another, being thus
made concomitantly.

7. §. From these Annual younger *Fibers* it is, that although the
*Cortical Body* and *Pith* are both of the same substantial nature, and
their *Pores* little different; yet whereas the *Pith*, which the first year
is green, and of all the *Parts* the fullest of *Sap*, becomes afterwards
white and dry: The *Cortical Body*, on the contrary, so long as the
*Tree* grows, ever keepeth green and moist, *sc.* because the said *Sap-Fibers*,
annually grow therein, and so communicate with it.

8. §. The *Pores* likewise of the *Lignous Body*, many of them,
in well-grown Timber, as in Oaken boards, are very conspicuous,
in cutting both lengthwise and traverse. They very seldom, if ever,
run one into another, but keep, like so many several *Vessels*, all along
distinct; *Tab. 3. f. 2. & 3.*  as by cutting, and so following any one of them as far as
you please, for a Foot or half a Yard, or more together, may be observ’d.
And so, the like, in any *Cane*.

9. §. Besides these, there are a lesser sort; which, by the help
only of a good *Spectacle Glass* may be observ’d.

10. §. And these are all the *Pores* visible without a *Microscope*.
The use of which, excepting in some few particulars, I have purposely
omitted in this first *Book*. Micrography. Mr. *Hook* sheweth us, besides these,
a third, and yet smaller Sort; and (as a confirmation of what, in
the Second *Chapter*, *C. 2. §. 8.*  I have said of the *Pores* of the *Lignous Body*
in general) that they are all continuous and prolonged by the length
of the *Trunk*, as are the greater ones: whereof he maketh Experiment,
by filling up, in a piece of *Char-coal*, all the said *Pores* with
*Mercury*; which appears to pass quite through them, in that by a
very good *Glass* it is visible in their Orifices at both ends; and without
a *Glass*, by the weight of the Coal alone, is also manifest. All
these I have seen, with the help of a good *Microscope*, in several
sorts of *Woods*.*Tab. 3. f. 7.*
 As they all appeare in a piece of *Oak*, cut transversely,
See *Tab. 3.*

11. §. Upon further Enquiry, I likewise find, That the *Pores*
of the *Lignous Body* in the *Trunks* of *Herbs*, which at first I only supposed,
by the help of good *Glasses*, are very fairly visible: each *Fibre*
being sometimes perforated by 30, 50, 100, or hundreds of *Pores*.
Or what I think is the truest notion of them, That each *Fibre*, though
it seem to the bare eye to be but *one*, yet is, indeed, a great number
of *Fibres* together; and every *Pore*, being not meerly a space betwixt
the several parts of the Wood, but the *Concave* of a *Fiber*. So that
if it be asked, what all that Part of a *Plant*, either *Herb* or *Tree*, which
is properly called the *Woody-Part*; what all that is, I suppose, That
it is nothing else but a *Cluster* of innumerable and most extraordinary
small *Vessels* or *Concave Fibers*: *Tab. 3. f. 6.* as in a Slice of the Trunk of *Burdock*
is apparent.

12. §. Next the *Insertions* of the *Cortical Body*, which in the
*Trunk* of a *Tree* saw’d athwart, are plainly discerned as they run
from the Circumference toward the Center; the whole Body of
the *Tree* being visibly compounded of two distinct Substances, that of
the several *Rings*, and that of the *Insertions*, running cross; shewing
that in some resemblance in a *Plain*, *Tab. 3. f. 5. & 8.* which the *Lines* of *Latitude* and
of the *Meridian* do in a *Globe*. The entrance of the *Insertions* into
the *Wood*, is also, upon striping off the Barque, very apparent; as
in the same *Fig. 8.*

13. §. These *Insertions* are likewise very conspicuous in Sawing
of *Trees* length-ways into Boards, and those plain’d, and wrought into
*Leaves* for *Tables*, *Wainscot*, *Trenchers*, and the like. In all which,
as in course *Trenchers* made of *Beech*, and *Tables* of *Oak*, there are
many parts which have a greater smoothness than the rest; *Tab. 3. f. 2. & Tab. 4. f. 1.* and are so
many *inserted Pieces* of the *Cortical Body*; which being by those of
the *Lignous*, frequently intercepted, seem to be discontinuous, although
in the *Trunk* they are really extended, in continued Plates,
throughout its Breadth.

14. §. These *Insertions*, although as is said, of a quite distinct
substance from the *Lignous Body*, and so no where truly incorporated
with it, yet being they are in all parts, the one as the *Warp*, the
other as the *Woof*, mutually *braced* and *interwoven* together, they
thus constitute one strong and firmly coherent Body; *Tab. 4. f. 1.* as the Timber
of any *Tree*.

15. §. As the Pores or Vessels are greater or less, so are the *Insertions*
also: To the bare eye usually the greater only are discernable:
But through an indifferent *Microscope* there are others also, much
more both numerous and small, distinctly apparent, *Tab. 3. f. 7.* as in a transverse
piece of *Oak*.

16. §. In none of all the *Pores* can we observe any thing which
may have the true nature and use of *Valves*, which is, Easily to admit
that, to which they will by no means allow a regress. And their nonexistence
is enough evident, from what in the first *Chapter* *C. 1. §. 42.* we have
said of the *Lobes* of the *Seed*: in whose *Seminal Root*, were there any
*Valves*, it could not be, that by a contrary *Course* of the *Sap*, they
should ever grow; which yet, where-ever they turn into *Dissimilar
Leaves*, they do. Or if we consider the growth of the *Root*, which
oftentimes is *upward* and *downward* both at once. And being cut
transversely, will bleed, both the same ways, with equal freedom.

17. §. The *Insertions* here in the *Trunk* give us likewise a sight
of the position of their *Pores*. For in a plained piece of *Oak*, as
in *Wainscot*, *Tables*, *&c.* besides the larger *Pores* of the *Lignous Body*,
which run by the *length* of the *Trunk*; *Tab. 3. f. 2.* the *Tract* likewise of those of
the *Insertions* may be observed to be made by the breadth, and so directly
cross. Nor are they continuous as those of the *Lignous Body*,
but very short, as those both of the *Cortical Body* and *Pith*, with
which the *Insertions*, as to their substance, are congenerous. Yet they
all stand so together, as to be plainly ranked in even *Lines* or *Rows*
throughout the breadth of the *Trunk*: As the *Tract* of those *Pores*
appears to the naked Eye, see in *Tab. 3. Fig. 9.* The *Pores* themselves
may be seen in the *Root* of a *Vine* described and figured in the Second
*Book*, as it appears through a good *Microscope*. *Tab. 17.*

18. §. The *Pores* of the *Pith* likewise being larger here in the
*Trunk*, are better observable than in the *Root*: the width whereof,
in comparison with their *Sides* so exquisitely thin, may by an *Hony-Comb*
be grosly exemplified; and is that also which the vast disproportion
betwixt the Bulk and Weight of a dry *Pith* doth enough declare.
In the *Trunks* of some *Plants*, they are so ample and transparent,
that in cutting both by the length and breadth of the *Pith*,
some of them through the transparency of the *Skins* by which they
are bounded, or of which they consist, would seem to be considerably

extended by the length of the *Pith*; but are really discontinuous
and short, and as ’tis said, somewhat answerable to the *Cells*
of an *Hony-Comb*. This is the nearest we can come to them, by the
bare Eye without the assistance of a good *Microscope*. Mr. *Hook*
sheweth in his *Micrography*, That the *Pores* of the *Pith*, particularly of
*Elder-Pith*, so far as they are visible, are all alike discontinuous; and
that the *Pith* is nothing else but (as he calls them) an heap of *Bubbles*.
Although, in regard they are not fluid, but fixed Parts, I shall
choose rather to call them, *Bladders*. As they appear through a good
*Glass*, in a piece of *Burdock*, See in *Tab. 3.* *Tab. 3. f. 6.* But a more particular
Description of the *Sizes*, *Figures*, and admirable *Textures* hereof,
I have given in several places in the following *Books*.

19. §. Besides what this Observation informs us of here, it
farther confirms what in the Second *Chapter* *C. 2. §. 3, 16, 17.* we have said of the
Original of the *Pith* and *Cortical Body*, and of the sameness of
both their natures with the *Parenchyma* of the *Seed*: which is nothing
else but a Mass of *Bladders*; *C. 1. §. 18. & Tab. 1. f. 9.* as in the First *Chapter* hath been
said.

20. §. In the *Piths* of many *Plants*, the greater *Pores* or *Bladders*
have some of them lesser ones within them, and some of them are
divided with cross Membranes: And betwixt their several sides, have, I
think, other smaller *Bladders* visibly interjected. However, that
they are all permeable, is most certain. They stand together not confusedly,
but in even *Ranks* or *Trains*; as those of the *Insertions* by the
breadth, so these by the length of the *Trunk*. And thus far there is a
general corresponding betwixt the parts of the *Root* and *Trunk*. Yet
are there some considerable Disparities betwixt them; wherein, and
how they come to pass, and to what especial Use and End, shall next
be said.

An Account of the *Growth* of the *Trunk*.
21. §. WE SAY then, that the *Sap* being in the *Root* by Filtrations,
Fermentations (and in what *Roots* needful, perhaps by Circulation
also) duly prepar’d; the prime part thereof passing through
the intermediate *Coarcture*, in due moderation and purity is entertain’d
at last into the *Trunk*. And the *Sap* of the *Trunk* being purer and
more volatile, and so it self apt to ascend; the motion of the *Trunk*
likewise will be more noble, receiving a disposition and tendency to
ascend therewith. And what by the *Sap* the *Trunk* is in part dipos’d
to, by the respective position and quantity of its Parts it is effectually
enabled. For whereas in the *Root* the *Lignous Body* being in proportion
with the *Cortical*, but little, and all lying close within its
Center; it must therefore needs be under its controul: on the contrary,
being here comparatively of greater quantity, and also more
dilated, and having divers of its Branches standing more abroad towards
the Circumference, as both in the *Leaves* and Body of the young *Trunk*
and *Plume*, is seen; it will in its own *magnetical* tendency to *ascend*,
reduce the *Cortical Body* to a compliance with it.

22. §. And the *Trunk* thus standing from under the restraint of the
Ground in the open Air, the disposition of its *Parts*, originally different
from that of the *Parts* in the *Root*, will not only be continued, but
improved. For by the force and pressure of the *Sap* in its collateral
Motion, the *Lignous Body* will now more freely and farther be dilated.

And this being dilated, the *Cortical Body* also, must needs be
*inserted*; and is therefore in proportion always, more or less, smaller
here in the *Trunk*, than in the *Root*. And as the *Cortical Body* lessens,
so the *Pith* will be enlarged, and by the same proportion is here
greater. And the *Pith* being enlarged it self, its *Pores* (the *Lignous
Body*, upon its dilatation, as it were tentering and stretching out all
their sides) must needs likewise be enlarged with it; and accordingly,
are ever greater in the *Pith* of the *Trunk*, than of the *Root*.
And the dilatation of the *Lignous Body* still continued, it follows,
that whereas the *Pith* descendent in the *Root*, is not only in proportion
less and less, but also in the smaller extremities thereof, and sometimes
higher, altogether absent: Contrariwise, in the *Trunk*, it is
not only continued to its top and smallest *Twigs*, but also there, in
proportion, equally ample with what it is in any other inferiour
part.

23. §. But although the openness of the Aer permitting, be always
alike; yet the Energy of the *Sap* effecting, being different; as
therefore that doth, the dilatation of the *Trunk*, will also vary. If
that be less, so is this; as in the *Trunks* of most *Trees*: If that be
greater, so this; as in *Herbs* is common; the *Lignous Body* being usually
so far dilated, that the *utmost Shootings* thereof may easily be
seen to jut out, and adjoyn to the *Skin*. And if the *Sap* be still of
greater energy, it so far dilates the *Lignous Body*, as not only to amplifie
the *Pith* and all its *Pores*; but also so far to stretch them out,
as to make them tear. Whereupon either running again into the
*Cortical Body*, or shrinking up towards it, the *Trunk* thus sometimes
becomes an *hollow Stalk*, the *Pith* being wholly, or in part voided.
But generally it keeps entire; and where it doth, the same proportion
and respect to the *Lignous* and *Cortical Bodies*, as is said. The
Consequences of all which will be, the *Strength* of the *Trunk*, the *Security*
and *Plenty* of the *Sap*, its *Fermentation* will be quicker, its *Distribution*
more effectual, and its *Advancement* more sufficient.

24. §. First, the Erect Growth and Strength of the *Trunk*; this
being, by the position of its several Parts, effected: for besides the slendering
of the *Trunk* still towards the top, the *Circumferential* position
of the *Lignous Body*, likewise is, and that eminently, hereunto subservient.
So that as the *Lignous Body*, in the smaller parts, of the *Root*
standing Central, we may thence conceive and see their pliableness to
any oblique motion; so here, on the contrary, the *Lignous Body* standing
wide, it thus becomes the Strength of the *Trunk*, and most advantageous
to its Perpendicular Growth. We see the same Design in
*Bones* and *Feathers*: The strongest *Bones*, as those in the Legs, are
hollow. Now should we suppose the same *Bone*, to be contracted into
a Solid; although now it would be no heavier, and in that respect,
as apt for motion; yet would it have far less strength, than as
its Parts are dilated to a *Circumferential* posture. And so for *Quills*,
which, for the same Reasons, in subserviency to flying, as they are exceeding
light; So, in comparison with the thinness of their *Sides*, they
are very strong, and much less apt to bend, than if contracted into a
Solid *Cylinder*. We see it not only in *Nature*, but *Art*. For hence it
is, that *Joyners* and *Carpenters* unite and set together their Timber-pieces
and several Works oftentimes with double Joynts; which, although

they are no thicker, than a single one might be made; yet standing
at a distance, have a greater strength than That could have. And
the same Architecture, will have the same use, in the *Trunks* of *Plants*;
in most whereof ’tis very apparent; as for instance, in *Corn*. For
*Nature* designing its *Sap* a great Ascent; for its higher maturity, hath
given it a tall *Trunk*: But to prevent its ravenous despoiling either of
the *Ear*, or *Soyl*; although it be tall, yet are its sides but thin: And
because again, it should grow not only tall and thriftily, but for avoiding
propping up, strongly too; therefore, the same proportion as its
heigth bears, to the thinness of its sides, doth the greatness of its Circumference
also; being so far dilated as to parallel a *Quil* it self.

25. §. Besides the position of the *Lignous Body* within the compass
of a *Ring*, there are some *Shootings* thereof, often standing beyond
the Circumference of the said *Ring*, making sometimes a triangular,
oftner a quadrangular Body of the *Trunk*. To the end, that the *Ring*,
being but thin, and not self-sufficient, these, like *Splinters* to *Bones*,
might add strength and stability to it.

26. §. Next, the security and plenty of the *Sap*. For should the
*Lignous Body*, as it doth in the smaller Parts of the *Root*, stand Central
here also, and so the *Cortical* wholly surround it: the greater part of
the *Sap* would thus be more immediately expos’d to the *Sun* and *Aer*;
and being lodged in a laxe Body, by them continually be prey’d upon,
and as fast as supplied to the *Trunk*, be exhausted. Whereas, the *Pith*
standing in the Center, the *Sap* therein being not only most remote from
the *Aer* and *Sun*, but by the *Barque*, and especially the *Wood*, being
also surrounded and doubly immur’d, will very securely and copiously
be convey’d to all the Collateral Parts, and (as shall be said
how) the top of the *Trunk*.

27. §. And the *Sap* by the amplitude, and great porosity of the
*Pith*, being herein more copious, its Fermentation also will be quicker;
which we see in all Liquors, by standing in a greater quantity together,
proceeds more kindly: And being *tun’d up* within the *Wood*,
is at the same time not only secur’d from loss, but all extream mutations;
the Day being thus, not too hot; nor the Night, too cold for
it.

28. §. And the Fermentation hereof being quicker, its motion
also will be stronger, and its Distribution more effectual, not only to
the dilatation of the *Trunk*, but likewise the shooting out of the
*Branches*. Whence it is, that in the Bodies of *Trees*, the *Barque* of it
self, though it be Sappy, and many *Fibres* of the *Lignous Body* mixed
with it, yet seldom sendeth forth any; and that in *Herbs*, those
with the least *Pith* (other advantages not supplying this defect) have
the fewest or smallest Branches, or other collateral Growths: and that
*Corn*, which hath no *Pith*, hath neither any Branches.

29. §. Lastly, the Advancement of the *Sap* will hence also be
more ready and sufficient. For the understanding where, and how,
we suppose, That in all *Trunks* whatsoever there are two Parts joyntly
hereunto subservient. In some, the *Lignous Body* and the *Cortical*, as
in older *Trunks*; the *Pith* being either excluded, or dried: But in
most, principally, the *Lignous Body* and *Pith*; as in most Annual
Growths of *Trees*; but especially *Herbs*, where the *Cortical Body* is
usually much and often wholly Inserted.

30. §. Of the *Lignous Body* it is so apparent by its *Pores*, or rather
by its *Vessels*, that we need no farther Evidence. For to what
end are *Vessels*, but for the conveyance of Liquor? And is that also,
which upon cutting the young Branch of a Sappy *Tree* or *Herb*, by
an accurate and steady view may be observed. But when I say
the *Vessels* of the *Lignous Body*, I mean principally them of the
*younger shootings*, both those which make the *new Ring*, and those
which are mixed with the *Cortical Body* in the *Barque*: that which
ascendeth by the *Pores* or *Vessels* of the Wood, being probably, because
in less quantity, more in form of a *Vapour*, than a *Liquor*. Yet
that which drenching into the sides of its *Pores*, is with all thereunto
sufficient Aliment; as we see *Orpine*, *Onions*, *&c.* only standing in
a moyster Aer will often grow. And being likewise in part supplied
by the *Insertions* from the younger *Shoots*: But especially because as
it is but little, so (considered as Aliment) it serveth only for the
growth of the *Wood*, and no more; whereas, the more copious Aliment
ascendent by the younger *Shoots*, subserves not only their own
growth, but the generation of others; and is besides with that in the
*Cortical Body* the Fountain of *Perspirations*, which we know even in
*Animals* are much more abundant than the *Nutritive Parts*; and
doubtless in a *Vegetable* are still much more.

31. §. But these *Pores*, although they are a free and open way
to the ascending *Sap*; yet that meer *Pores* or *Vessels* should be able of
themselves to advance the *Sap* with that speed, strength and plenty,
and to that height, as is necessary, cannot probably be supposed. It
follows then, that herein we must grant the *Pith* a joynt service. And
why else is the *Pith* in all Primitive *Growths* the most *Sappy* part, why
hath it so great a stock of *Sap*, if not, after due maturation within it
self, still to be disbursed into the *Fibres* of the *Lignous Body*? Why
are the Annual *Growths* of all both *Herbs* and *Trees*, with great *Piths*,
the quickest and the longest? But how are the *Pores* or *Bladders*
of the *Pith* permeable? That they are so, both from their being capable
of a repletion with *Sap*, and of being again wholly emptied of
it, and again, instead thereof fill’d with *Aer*, is as certain as that they
are *Pores*. That they are permeable, by the breadth, appears from
the dilatation of the *Lignous Body*, and from the production of *Branches*,
as hath been, and shall hereafter be said. And how else is there
a Communion betwixt *This* and the *Cortical Body*? That they are so
also, by the length, is probable, because by the best *Microscope* we
cannot yet observe, that they are visibly more open by the breadth,
than by the length. And withall are ranked by the length, as those
of the *Insertions* by the breadth of the *Trunk*. But if you set a
piece of dry *Elder-Pith* in some tinged Liquor, why then doth it
not penetrate the *Pores*, so as to ascend through the Body of the *Pith*?
The plain reason is, because they are all fill’d with *Aer*. Whereas the *Pith*
in a Vegetating *Plant*, as its Parts or *Bladders* are still generated, they
are at the same time also fill’d with *Sap*; which, as ’tis gradually spent,
is still repaired by more succeeding, and so the *Aer* still kept out; as in
all Primitive *Growths*, and the *Pith* of *Elder* it self: Yet the same *Pith*,
by reason of the following Winter, wanting a more copious and quick
supply of *Sap*, thus once become, ever after keeps dry. And since in the
aforesaid Trial the Liquor only ascends by the sides of the *Pith*, that

is of its broken *Bladder*, we should thence by the same reason conclude
that they are not penetrable by the breadth neither, and so no
way; and then it need not be ask’d what would follow. But certainly
the *Sap* in the *Bladders* of the *Pith* is discharged and repaired
every moment, as by its shriv’ling up, upon cutting the *Plant*, is evident.

32. §. We suppose then, that as the *Sap* ascendeth into the *Trunk*
by the *Lignous Body*, so partly also by the *Pith*. For a piece of *Cotton*
with one end immers’d in some tinged Liquor, and with the other
erect above, though it will not imbibe the Liquor so far as to over-run
at the top, yet so as to advance towards it, it will. So here, the
*Pith*, being a porous and spongy Body, and in its Vegetating state, its
*Pores* or *Bladders* being also permeable, as a curious *Filtre* of *Natures*
own contrivance, it thus advanceth, or as people use to say, sucks up
the *Sap*. Yet as it is seen of the Liquor in the *Cotton*; so likewise are
we to suppose it of the *Sap* in the *Pith*; that though it riseth up for
some way, yet is their some term, beyond which it riseth not, and
towards which the motion of the ascending *Sap* is more and more broken,
weak and slow, and so the quantity thereof less and less. But
because the *Sap* moveth not only by the length, but breadth of
the *Pith*; at the same time therefore as it partly ascendeth by the
*Pith*, it is likewise in part pressed into the *Lignous Body* or into its
*Pores*. And since the motion of the *Sap* by the breadth of the *Pith*
not being far continued, and but collateral, is more prone and easie,
than the perpendicular, or by its length; it therefore follows, that
the collateral motion of the *Sap*, at such a height or part of the
*Pith*, will be equally strong with the perpendicular at another part,
though somewhat beneath it; and that where the perpendicular is
more broken and weak, the collateral will be less; and consequently
where the perpendicular tendency of the *Sap* hath its term, the collateral
tendency thereof, and so its pressure into the *Pores* or *Vessels* of
the *Lignous Body*, will still continue. Through which, in that they
are small, and so their sides almost contiguous, the *Sap* as fast as pressed
into them will easily run up; as in very small Glasse Pipes, or betwixt
the two halves of a Stick first slit, and then tyed somewhat loosely
together, may also any Liquor be observed to do. By which Advantage
the facility and strength of that ascent will be continued
higher in the said *Vessels*, than in the *Pith*. Yet since this also, as
well as that in the *Pith* will have its term; the *Sap*, although got
thus far, would at last be stagnant, or at least its ascent be very sparing,
slow and feeble, if not some way or other re-inforced. Wherefore,
as the *Sap* moving by the breadth of the *Pith*, presseth thence
into the *Vessels* of the *Lignous Body*; so having well fill’d these, is
in part by the same Collateral motion disbursed back, into a yet
higher Region of the *Pith*. By which partly, and partly, by that portion
of the *Sap*, which in its perpendicular ascent was before lodged
therein; ’tis thus here, as in any inferiour place equally replenished.
Whereupon the force and vigour of the perpendicular motion of the
*Sap* herein, will likewise be renew’d; and so its Collateral motion also,
and so its pressure into the *Vessels* of the *Lignous Body*, and consequently
its ascent therein: and so by a pressure, from these into the *Pith*, and
from the *Pith* into these, reciprocally carried on; a most ready and copious
ascent of the *Sap* will be continued, from the bottom to the top,
though of the highest *Tree*.

### An Appendix.

*Of Trunk-Roots and Claspers.*

THE distinct *Parts* whereof these are composed, are the same
with those of the *Trunk*, and but the continuation of them.

1. §. *Trunk-Roots* are of two kinds: Of the one, are those that
vegetate by a direct descent: The place of their Eruption is sometimes
all along the *Trunk*; as in *Mint*, &c. Sometimes only at its
utmost point, as in the *Bramble*.

2. §. The other sort are such as neither ascend nor descend, but
shoot forth at right Angles with the *Trunk*; which therefore, though
as to their *Office*, they are true *Roots*, yet as to their *Nature*, they are
a *Middle Thing* betwixt a *Root* and a *Trunk*.

3. §. *Claspers*, though they are but of one kind, yet their Nature
is double; not a mean betwixit that of the *Root* and that of the
*Trunk*, but a compound of both; as in their Circumvolutions, wherein
they often mutually ascend and descend, is seen.

4. §. The use of these *Parts* may be observed as the *Trunk* Mounts,
or as it Trails. In the mounting of the *Trunk*, they are for Support
and Supply. For Support, we see the *Claspers* of *Vines*: the
*Branches* whereof being very long, fragile and slender; unless by
their *Claspers*, they were mutually contain’d together, they must
needs by their own weight, and that of their Fruit, undecently fall;
and be also liable to frequent breaking. So that the whole care
is divided betwixt the Gardener and Nature; the Gardener, with
his Ligaments of Leather, secures the main Branches; and Nature,
with these of her own finding, secures the Less. Their Conveniency
to which end, is seen in their *Circumvolutions*, a motion, not proper
to any other *Part*: As also in their toughness, though much more
slender than the *Branches* whereon they are appendent.

5. §. The *Claspers* of *Bryony* have a retrograde motion about every
Third *Circle*, to the form a Doublet-Clasp. Probably for the more
certain hold; which, if it miss one way, it may be sure to take
another.

6. §. For Supply, we see the *Trunk-Roots* of *Ivy*. For mounting
very high, and being of a closer or more compact Substance than
that of a *Vine*; the *Sap* could not be sufficiently supplied to the upper
*Sprouts*, unless these, to the *Mother-Root*, were joyntly assistant. Yet
serve they for support likewise; whence they shoot out, not as in
*Cresses*, *Brook-lime*, &c. reciprocally on each side, but commonly, all
on one; that so they may be fastned at the nearest hand.

7. §. In the Trailing of the *Trunk*, they serve for stabiliment,
propagation and shade. For stabiliment, the *Claspers* of *Cucumbers*
are of good use. For the *Trunk* and *Branches* being long and fragile,
the Brushes of the Winds would injuriously hoise them to and fro, to
the dammage both of themselves and their tender Fruits, were

they not by these Ligaments brought to good Association and Settlement.

8. §. As for this end, so for Propagation, the *Trunk-Roots* of
*Chamæmile* do well serve. Whence we have the reason of the common
observation, that it grows better by being trod upon: the Mould,
where too laxe, being thus made to lie more conveniently about the
said *Trunk-Roots* newly bedded therein; and is that which is sometimes
also effected in Rowling of *Corn*.

9. §. For both these ends, Serve the *Trunk-Roots* of *Strawberries*;
as also for shade; for in that all *Strawberries* delight; and by the trailing
of the *Plant* is well obtain’d. So that as we are wont to tangle
the Twigs of *Trees* together to make an *Arbour Artificial*; the same
is here done to make a *Natural one*: as likewise by the *Claspers* of
*Cucumbers*. For the *Branches* of the one by the Linking of their
*Claspers*, and of the other by the Tethering of their *Trunk-Roots*, being
couched together; their tender Fruits thus lie under the Umbrage
of a *Bower* made of their own Leaves.
