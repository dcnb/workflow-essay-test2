### Of the FRUIT.

HE
 general composition of all *Fruits* is one,
that is, their *Essential* and truly *Vital Parts*,
are in all the same, and but the continuation
of those which in the other *Parts* of a *Plant*,
we have already observed. Yet because by
the different *Constitutions* and *Tinctures* of these
*Parts*, divers considerably different *Fruits* result;
I shall therefore take a particular view
of the more known and principal of them, *sc.*
*Apples*, *Pears*, *Plums*, *Nuts* and *Berries*.

2. §. AN APPLE, if cut traverse, appears constituted of four
distinct *Parts*, the *Pilling*, the *Parenchyma*, *Branchery*, and *Coare*. The
*Pilling* is only the spreading and dilatation of the *Skin*, or utmost
part of the *Barque* in the *Branch*. The *Parenchyma*, when full ripe,
is a tender delicate Meat. Yet as the *Pilling* is but the Continuation of
the utmost part of the *Barque*; so is this, but the continuance and ampliation,
or (as I may call it) the swelth and superbience of the *Inner
Part* thereof; which upon observation of a young and Infant-*Apple*
especially, is evident. Thus we see the *Pith*, which is often tough;
in many *Roots*, as *Parsneps*, *Turneps*, &c. is tender and edible. So
here, the *Parenchyma*, though originally no more than the *Barque*,
yet the copiousness and purity of its *Sap* being likewise effectual to
the largness and fineness of its growth, it thus becomes a soft and tender
meat. The *Branchery* is nothing else but the Ramifications of the *Lignous
Body* throughout all the parts of the *Parenchyma*; the greater
*Branches* being likewise by the *Inosculations* of the less (as in the *Leaf*)
united together. The main *Branches* are usually Twenty: Ten are
spred and distributed through the *Parenchyma*, most of them enarching
themselves towards the *Cork* or *Stool* of the *Flower*: The other
Ten, running from the *Stalk* in a directer Line, at last meet the former
at the said *Cork*, and are there osculated with them. Of these
latter, five are originated from one; which running along the Center
of the *Stalk*, and part of the *Parenchyma* of the *Fruit*, is therein at
last divided. To these the Coats of the *Kernels* are fastned. So that
whereas most of these *Branches* were originally extended even beyond
the *Fruit*, and inserted into the *Flower* for the due growth

thereof; the *Fruit* afterwards growing to some head, and so intercepting
and preying upon the *Aliment* of the *Flower*, starves that
and therefrom supersedes the service of the said *Branches* to it self,
fifteen for its *Parenchyma*, and five for its *Seed*. The *Coar* is originated
from the *Pith*; for the *Sap* finding room enough in the *Parenchyma*,
through which to dispence it self all abroad, quits the *Pith*, which
thereby hardens into a *Coar*. Thus we see the *Insertions*, although
originate from the *Cortical Body*, yet their *Parts* being, by the *Inosculations*
of the *Lignous*, so much compress’d and made to co-incide
together, they become a *Body* very compact and dense. And in the
*Barque* the same thing is effected by *Arefaction* only, or a meer *voydance*
of the *Sap*; the *Inner Part* whereof, though soft and sappy, yet its superficial
*Rind* is often so hard and smooth, that it may be fairly writ upon.
The *Parts* of an *Apple*, See in the *Figures* belonging to the *Third*
**Part** of the *Fourth* **Book**.

3. §. IN A PEAR there are five distinct *Parts*, the *Pilling*, the
*Parenchyma*, *Branchery*, *Calculary*, and *Acetary*. *Tab. 4. f. 14.* The three former are
here and in an *Apple* much alike; saving that here the *Inner* or *Seed-Branches*
ordinarily stand double. The *Calculary* (most observable
in rough-tasted, or *Choak-Pears*) is a *Congeries* of little stony *Knots*.
They are many of them dispersed throughout the whole *Parenchyma*:
But lying more continuous and compact together towards the Center
of the *Pear*, surround the *Acetary* there, in a somewhat Globular Form.
About the *Stalk* they stand more distant; but towards the *Cork* or
*Stool* of the *Flower*, they still grow closer, and there at last gather
(almost) into the firmitude of a *Plum-stone* it self. Within this lies
the *Acetary*; ’tis allways sour, and by the bounding of the *Calculary*
of a *Globular Figure*. ’Tis a simple *Body*, having neither any of the
*Lignous* branched in it, nor any *Calculous Knots*. It is of the same substantial
nature with the outer *Parenchyma*; but whether it be absolutely
one with it, or be derived immediately from the *Pith*, my Enquiries
yet made, determine not.

4. §. The Original of the *Calculary* I seem to have neglected. But
hereof we may here best say, that whereas all the other *Parts* are *Essential*
and truly *Vital*; the *Calculary* is not: but that the several *Knots*
whereof it consists, are only so many meer *Concretions* or *Precipitations*
out of the *Sap*; as in *Urines*, *Wines*, and other *Liquors*, we often
see. And that the *Precipitation* is made by the mixture and re-action
of the *Tinctures* of the *Lignous* and *Cortical Bodies* upon each other:
Even as all *Vegetable Nutrition* or *Fixation* of *Parts* is also made by the
joynt efficiency of the two same *Tinctures*, as hath been said. Hence
we find, that as the *Acetary* hath no *Branches* of the *Lignous Body*, so
neither hath it any *Knots*. Hence likewise it is, that we have so different
and contrary a tast in the *Parenchyma* beyond the *Calculary*, from
that in the *Acetary*: For whereas this is sour, that, wherein the said
*Precipitations* are made, is sweet; being much alike effect to what we
find in mixing of *Corals*, &c. with *Vinegar* or other *acid Liquors*. The
*Parts* of a *Pear*, See in *Tab. 4.* But especially in the *Figures* belonging
to the *Third* **Part** of the *Fourth* **Book**.

5. §. IN A PLUM (to which the *Cherry*, *Apricot*, *Peach*, *Walnut*,
&c. ought to be referr’d) there are four distinct *Parts*, the *Pilling*,
the *Parenchyma*, *Branchery* and *Stone*. The *Pilling* and *Parenchyma* are,
as to their Original, with those of an *Apple* or *Pear*, both alike. As
likewise the *Branchery*; but differently ramified. In *Plums* (I suppose
all) there are five main *Out-Branches*, which run along the Surface
of the *Stone* from the *Basis* to the point thereof, four of them by
one *Ridge*, and one by the other opposite to it. *Tab. 4. f. 15.* In an *Apricot* there is
the same number, but the single *Branch* runs not upon the *Surface*, but
through the *Body* of the *Stone*. There are likewise two or three
smaller *Branches*, which run in like manner under the other *Ridge* for
some space, and then advancing into the *Parenchyma*, therein disperse
themselves: These latter sort in *Peaches* are numerous throughout.

6. §. But notwithstanding the different disposition of the *Branches*
of the *Fruits* aforesaid; yet is there one *Branch* dispos’d in one and
the same manner in them all. The entrance hereof into the *Stone* is at
its *Basis*; from whence running through its Body, and still inclining
or arching it self towards its *Concave*, is at last, about its *Cone*, thereinto
emergent, *Tab. 4. f. 15.* where the *Coats* of the *Seed* are appendent to it. Of
the *Seed-Branch* ’tis therefore observable that after its entrance into
the *Fruit*, ’tis always prolonged therein to a considerable length;
as is seen not only in *Apples*, &c. where the *Seed* stands a good distance
from the *Stalk*; but in *Plums* likewise, where it stands very near it;
in that here the *Seed-Branch*, as is said, never strikes through the *Stone*
into the *Coats* of the *Seed* directly, but runs through a *Chanel* cut in
the *Stone*, till it issues, near the *Cone*, into the *Concave* thereof.

7. §. The *Stone* though it seem a simple Body, yet it is compounded
of different ones. The Inner *Part* thereof, as it is by far the thinnest,
so is it the most *dense*, *white*, *smooth* and *simple*. The Original
is from the *Pith*; difficult, but curious to observe: For the *Seed-Branch*,
not striking directly and immediately quite through the
*Basis* of the *Stone*, but in the manner as is above described, carries a
considerable *Part* of the *Pith*, now gather’d round about it, as its *Parenchyma*,
along with it self; which upon its entrance into the concave
of the *Stone* about its farther end, is there in part spread all over it, as
the *Lining* thereof. The outer and very much thicker *Part*, consisteth
partly of the like *Precipitations* or concrete Particles, as in a *Pear*;
being gathered here much more closely, not only to a *Contiguity*, but
a *Coalition* into one entire *Stone*; as we see in *Pears* themselves, especially
towards the *Cork*, they gather into the like Stoniness; or as a
*Stone*, *Mineral*, or *Animal*, is oftentimes the product of accumulated
*Gravel*. But as the *Parenchyma* is mixed with the *Concretions* in the
*Calculary*, so is it also, though not visibly, with these in the *Stone*,
the *ground* of the *Stone* being indeed a perfect *Parenchyma*; but by
the said *Concretions* so far alter’d, as to become dry, hard and undistinguishable
from them. All which Particulars, are observable
only in the several degrees of *Growth* in the young *Fruit*. And are
represented in *Tab. 4.* But especially by the several *Figures* belonging
to the *Third* and *Fourth* **Parts** of the *Fourth* **Book**.

8. §. IN A NUT (to which an *Akern* is analogous) there are
three general *Parts*, the *Cap*, *Shell*, and *Pith*. The *Cap* is constituted
of a *Pilling* and *Parenchyma*, derived from the *Barque*; and *Ramulets*
from the *Lignous Body* of the *Branch*. The *Shell* likewise is not one
simple Body, but compounded. The Superficial *Part* thereof is originated
from the *Pilling* or *Skin* of the *Cap*, from the inside whereof
it is, in a Duplicature, produc’d and spred over the *Shell*. Which, if
you look at the *Basis* of the *Shell*, is farther evident: for that being continuous
with the *Parenchyma* of the *Cap*, without the interposure of the
*Skin*, the said superficial *Part* is there wanting. The thicker and inner
*Part* of the *Shell* consisteth of the same *Parenchyma* as that of the *Cap*,
with a *Congeries* of *Precipitations* silled up, as in a *Stone*. And as the
*Lignous Body* is branched in a *Stone*, so, with some difference, in a
*Shell*. The *outer Branches* or *Ramulets* are numerous, each issuing out
of the *Parenchyma* of the *Cap*, and entring the *Shell* at the *Circumference*
of its *Basis*, and so running betwixt its superficial and inner
*Parts* towards the *Cone*, round about. The *Inner* or *Seed-Branch* is single,
entring in, as do the other, at the *Basis* of the *Shell*, but at the
*Center* thereof: from whence it runs, not through the *Shell*, as in
*Plums* through the *Stone*; but through the *Pith*, as far as the *Cone*,
where the *Coats* of the *Seed* hang appendent to it. The *Pith* whether
derived from the same part both in name and nature in the *Branch*
and *Stalk*; or from the *Cortical Body*, I yet determine not. The
*Parts* of a *Nut*, See in the *Figures* belonging to the *Third* **Part** of the
*Fourth* **Book**.

9. §. A BERRY, as a *Gooseberry* (to which *Corinths*, *Grapes
Hips*, &c. are to be referr’d) consisteth, besides the *Seed*, of the
three general *Parts*, *Pilling*, *Parenchyma* and *Branchery*. The *Pilling*
is originated as in the foregoing *Fruits*. The *Parenchyma* is double,
as likewise in some other *Berries*. The *outer* is commonly, together
with the *Pilling*, call’d the *Skin*, and is that part we spit out, being
of a sour tast. Now as the *Pilling* is originated from the *outer*, so this
from the *inner Part* of the *Barque*; and accordingly the *Pores* thereof
may be observed plainly of a like shape with those both of the *Cortical
Body* and *Pith*. The *Inner* or *Pulp* is of a sweet taste, and is
the *Part* we eat: It is of a Substance so laxe and tender, as it would seem
to be only a thicker or jellied *Juice*; although this likewise be a true
*Parenchyma*, something like that of an *Orange* or *Limon*, with its
*Pores* all fill’d up with *Liquor*. The *Branchery* is likewise double:
The *Exterior* runs betwixt the *Pilling* and *Outer Parenchyma* in arched
*Lines*, from the *Stalk* to the *Stool* of the *Flower*. These *outer Branches*,
though of various number at the *Stalk*, yet at the *Cork* are
usually ten principal ones; five for the five *Leaves* of the *Flower*,
and five for the *Attire*. The *Inner main Branches* are two, diametrically
opposite to each other, and at the *Cork* with the other inosculated.
From these two are branched other smaller, every one having a *Seed*
appendent to it, whose *Coats* it entreth by a double *Filament*, one at
the *Basis*, the other at the *Cone*. They are all very white and turgent,
and by a slaunt cut, may be observ’d concave; thus representing
themselves analogous to so many true *spermatick Vessels*. The

*Parts* of a *Gooseberry*, See in the *Figures* belonging to the *Third*
**Part** of the *Fourth* **Book**.

10. §. The Uses of *Fruits* are for *Man*, (sometimes also other
*Animals*, as are *Akerns* and *Haws*) and for the *Seed*. For *Man*, they
are so variously desirable, that till our *Orchards* and *Store-Chambers*,
*Confectioners-Stoves* and *Apothecaries-Shops*, our *Ladies Closets*, their
*Tables* or *Hands* are empty of them, I shall not need to enquire for
what. If it be asked, how the *Fruit* becomes, generally above all
the other *Parts*, so pleasant a Meat? It is partly from the *Sap*, the
grosser portion thereof being deposited in the *Leaves*, and so the
purer hereunto reserved. Partly from the *Globular Figure* of the
*Fruit*. For the *Sap* being thus in a greater quantity herein, and in
all Parts equally diffus’d, the *Concoction* hereof, as in a *Vessel*, is with
greatest advantage favoured and promoted. Wherefore all *Fruits*,
which we eat raw, how small soever, are of a *Globular* Form, or
thereunto approaching; and the nearer, the delicater; amongst *Apples*,
the *Pipin*; amongst *Pears*, the *Burgundian*; and amongst all
*Fruits*, the *Grape*; and amongst *Grapes*, the roundest, are of all, the
most dainty.

11. §. The visible cause of this *Globular Figure*, is the *Flower*;
or the Inosculation of all the main *Branches* at the *Stool* of the *Flower*;
and upon the fall of the *Flower*, the obtuseness, and with *Wind* and
*Sun*, as it were the *seaing* of their several ends: For thus the *Sap*
entering the *Fruit*, being not able to effect, either a *Disunion*, or a
*shooting* forth of the said *Branches*, and so to carry on their *Growth*
in length; they must of necessity be enarch’d, and with the *Parenchyma*
more and more expand themselves. Whereas were they
disposed and qualified otherwise, than as is said; instead of forming
a *Fruit* within bounds, they would run out into all extravagance, and
even into another little *Tree* or *Leafy Growth*.

12. §. To the *Seed*, the *Fruit* is serviceable; First, in order to
its being supply’d with a due and most convenient *Sap*, the greater
part thereof, and that which is less elaborated, being, in its passage towards
the *Seed*, thereinto received; the *Fruit* doing the same office
to the *Seed*, which the *Leaves* do to the *Fruit*; the *Sap* in the *Fruit*
being, in a laxe comparison, as the *Wine*; and that for the *Seed*, a
small part of the highest Spirit rectified from it.

13. §. So likewise for its Protection, in order to the prosperous
carrying on and perfecting of its generation, and security being perfected.
Which protection it gives not only to the Seminal *Sap* and *Seed*
it self, but ever also to its *Seed-Branch*. Thus we see an *Apple*, besides
that it is it self of ample compass, for the sake of its *Seed*, hath
likewise its *Coar*; as if it were not sufficient, that the Walls of their
Room are so very thick, unless also *wainscoated*. In a *Pear* again,
where the *Parenchyma* is of less compass than that of an *Apple*, to what
protection this affords, that of the *Calculary* is super-added. But in a
*Plum*, where the *Parenchyma* is exceeding tender, and in a *Peach*, which
hangs late, and till Autumn Frosts approach, we have not only the
Rubbish of a *Calculary*, but stout Stone-Walls. Within which also,
not only the *Seed* it self, but the *Seed-Branch* is evermore immur’d.
Lastly, in a *Nut*, where the *Shell* being not surrounded with a *Parenchyma*,
that protection is wanting without, ’tis answer’d by an ample

*Pith* within it; and the *Seed-Branch* likewise included, not meerly
in the *Body* of the *Shell*, as in a *Plum*, but within the *Pith* it self.
So necessary is this design, that what the Hen by Incubation or
Hovering, is to the Egg or Chick; that the whole *Fruit*, by comprehension,
is to the *Seed*.
