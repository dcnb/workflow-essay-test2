### CHAP. IV.

### Of the FLORID ATTIRE.

![I](images/i_drop_i_153.jpg)
N
THIS *Attire* there is also much Elegant Variety,
according to the *Description* we have given of it in
the *First* **Book**. It always consists of several
*Suits*; Ten, Twenty, Fourty, a Hundred, or more, according
to the *Bigness* of the *Flower*. And every *Suit*
most commonly, of three distinct *Parts*, all of a Regular, but
Different *Figure*. The utmost Part, is always like a little
*Flower* with Five *Leaves* and a *Tubular Base*, like
that of *Cowslip*. *Tab. 59.*
So that every *Flower* with the *Florid Attire*, Embosomes,
or is, a *Posy* of perfect *Flowers*.

2. §. In some *Flowers*, every one of these *Florets*, is encompassed
with an *Hedg* of *Hairs*; and every *Hair* branched
on both sides almost like a *Sprig* of *Fir*;
 *Tab. 59.*
 as in *Aster Atticus*,
*Golden-Rod*, and others.

3. §. The *Base* of the
*Floret* is usually *Cylindrick*, but sometimes Square, as
in *French Marigold*. And the *Leaves* hereof which, for the
most part, *Tab. 60.* are Smooth on
the Inside, in the same *Flower* are all over *Hairy*. And
the Edges of these little *Flowers*, are frequently *Ridged*,
or as it were, *Hem’d*, like the Edge of a *Band*.

4. §. The midlemost of the Three *Parts*, which I call the
*Sheath*, *B. 1. Ch. 5.* is
usually fastened towards the *Top*, or else at the *Bottom*
of the *Floret*. *Tab. 60, 61,
62.*This is rather indented, than parted into *Leaves*.
The *Surface* seldom Plain or Even, but wrought with Five
*Ridges*, and as many *Gutters* running almost Parallel from
the *Top* to the *Bottom*.

*B. 1. Ch. 5.* 5. §. The *Inmost Part*, which I call the
*Blade*, runs through the hollow of the Two Former, and so is
fastned, with the *Floret*, to the convex of the *Seed-Case*.
The *Head* and *Sides* of this *Part*, is always beset
round about with *Globulets*, commonly through a *Glass*,
as big as a *Turnep-seed*, or a great *Pins-Head*. In some
*Plants* growing close to the *Blade*, as in the common
*Marigold*; *Tab. 60, 61, 62.*
in the *French*, and others, upon *Pedicils* or little
slender *Stalks*. These, as the *Blade* springeth up from
within the *Sheath*, are still rubed off, and so stand like a
*Powder* on them both. And sometimes, as in *Cichory*, they
seem to grow on the Inside of the *Sheath*,
if it be split with a small *Pin*: as also in *Knapweed*,
in which they are numerous. Yet in the *Seed-like Attire*,
always more numerous, than in the *Florid*.

6. §. The
*Head* of the *Blade* is always divided into *Two*,
and sometimes into *Three Parts*, as in *Cichory*;
 *Tab. 58,* &c. which, by degrees,
curl outward, after the manner of *Scorpion-Grass*.

7. §. The *Description* now given, agrees principally to the
*Corymbiferous Kind*, as *Tansy*, *Chamemile*,
and the like. But in *Scorzonera*, as also *Cichory*,
*Hawk-Weed*, *Mous-ear* and all the *Intybous* Kind,
with many

more, the *Attire* is not separate from the *Foliature*,
so as to stand within that in one entire *Posy*; but every
*Leaf* of the *Flower* hath its own *Attire* apart. For
the sake of which, the *Basis* of every *Leaf* is formed into
a little *Tube* or *Pipe*,*Tab.
62.* whereby it embosomes its own *Attire* within it
self. Consisting commonly of *Two Parts*, a *Sheath* and a
*Blade*: the *Leaf* it self answering to the *Floret*
in other *Flowers*.

8. §. In some *Plants*, besides
the *Attire* or *Posy* in the midle of the *Flower*;
the *Leaves* also have each their own to themselves, as in
*Marigold*: *Tab. 61.* yet
this, as I take it, consisting only of one single *Part*, which
answers to the *Blade*; the *Leaf* it self being as the
*Sheath*.

9. §. In many *Plants*, this *Florid
Attire* is very large; so that not only the *Suits*,
 *Tab. 61.* but also the several
*Parts* whereof every *Suit* consists, being throughly
ripe and well blown open, are all visible to the bare Eye, as in
*Knapweed*, and all the *Thistle Kind*. This *Attire*
is all the *Flower*, that this sort of *Plants* have;
being, though *Empal’d*, yet without any *Foliature*.

10. §. And sometimes, there is little or no *Flower*
besides this *Attire*, although extream small, as in *Golden
Rod*, *Wormwood* and others. Where it may be noted, That the
*Medicine* called *Wormseed* or *Semen Santonici*, is no
Sort of *Seed*, but the *Buds* of small *Flowers*, or of
the *Florid Attire* of that *Plant*.
