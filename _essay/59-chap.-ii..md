### Of the NUMBER and MOTIONS of Seeds.

ATURE
hath secured the *Propagation* of *Plants*
several ways, but chiefly by the *Seed*: for the *Production*
of which, the *Root*, *Leaves*, *Flower*, and
*Fruit*, do all officiate, as hath been shewed. And
according as the *Plant*, or the *Seed* it bears, is
more liable to be destroyed, Provision is made for
*Propagation*, either by a greater number of *Seeds*,
or other ways. So the *Seeds* of *Strawberry*, being gathered, or eaten
by *Vermin*, with the *Fruit*; the *Plant* is therefore easily propagated by
*Trunk-Roots*. So *Poppy*, being an annual *Plant*, is highly prolifick:
for instance, the *White Poppy*; which commonly bears about four mature
*Heads*, in each of which, there are at least ten *Partitions*, on both
sides whereof, the *Seeds* grow; and upon ¼ᵗʰ part of one side, about
100 *Seeds*; that is, 800 on one *Partition*: which being multiplied
by 10 (the number of *Partitions*) makes 8000; and 8000 again
by 4 (the number of *Heads*) makes 32000 *Seeds*, the yearly product
of that *Plant*.

2. §. So in *Typha major*, the *Seeds* being blow’n off and sow’n
(as the Eggs of many *Fishes* spawn’d) with great hazard, they are
strangely numerous. For as they stand altogether upon the *Spike*, they
make a *Cylinder* at least six Inches long, and near ⅝ᵗʰˢ of an Inch in Diametre,
or an Inch and ¾ about. Now 9 of these *Seeds*, set side to
side, as they stand on the *Spike*, make but ⅛ᵗʰ of an Inch; so that 72
make a line of an Inch in Length. But because upon the *Spike*, the
*Hairs* belonging to the *Seeds* come between them; we will abate 10,
and count but 62. To which ¾ᵗʰˢ of 62, that is (without the Fraction)
46 being added, makes 108 for the Circuit of the *Cylinder*.
And the *Cylinder* being six Inches long, there are six times 62, that is,
372, for a Line the length of the *Cylinder*. Which number being
multiplied by 108, produceth 40176 the number of *Seeds* which stand
upon one *Stalk*; and so, upon three *Stalks*, which one *Plant* commonly
bears, there are in one year, above a hundred and twenty Thousand
*Seeds*.

3. §. SO SOON as the *Seed* is ripe, Nature taketh several *Methods*
for its being duly sow’n: not only in the opening of the *Uterus*,
as in some Instances⁠[69] hath already been seen; but also in the make
of the *Seed* it self. For *First*, the *Seeds* of many *Plants*, which affect
a peculiar *Soil* or *Seat*, as of *Arum*, *Poppy*, &c. are heavy and small
enough, without further care, to fall directly down into the Ground:
and so to grow in the same place where themselves had their *Birth*.

[69]
 *P. 3. Ch. 5.  
 Tab. 70, & 71.*

4. §. But if they are so large and light, as to be exposed to the
wind, they are often furnished with one or more *Hooks*; To stay them
from straying over far from their proper place, till by the fall of *Leavs*
or otherwise, they are safely lodged. So the *Seeds* of *Avens* have one
single *Hook*, those of *Agrimony* and *Goose-grass*, many; *Tab. 72.* both the former,
loving a *Bank* for warmth, the latter, a *Hedge* for its support.

5. §. On the contrary, many *Seeds* are furnished with *Wings* or
*Feathers*. Partly, with the help of the Wind to carry them, when
they are ripe, from off the *Plant*, as those of *Ash*, *Maple*, *Orach*, &c.
lest staying thereon too long, they should either be corrupted, or
miss their season. And partly, to enable them to make their flight,
more or less, abroad: that so they may not, by falling together, come
up too thick; and that if one should miss a good *Soyl* or *Bed*, another
may hit. So the *Kernels* of *Pine* have wings not unlike to those of
some *Insects*; yet very short, in respect of the weight of the *Seed*; *Tab. 72.*
whereby they flye not in the *Aer*, but like domestick *Fowls*, only
flutter upon the Ground. But those of *Typha*, *Dandelion* and most
of the *Pappous* kind, with many more, have very long and numerous
*Feathers*, by which they are wafted every way, and to any distance
necessary for the aforesaid purposes.

6. §. Again, there are some *Seeds*, which are scattered not by
flying abroad, but by being either *Spurted*, or *Slung* away. The first
are those of *Woodsorrel*; which having a running *Root*, Nature sees it fit
to sow the *Seeds* at some distance. The doing of which is effected by
a white thick and sturdy *Cover* of a *Tendinous* or *Springy Nature*, in
which the *Seed* lies within the *Case*. *Tab. 72.* This *Cover*, so soon as it begins
to drye, bursts open on one side, in an instant, and is violently turned
inside outward, as you would turn the *Gizard* of a *Fowl*; and so
smartly throws off the *Seed*.

7. §. The *Seeds* of *Harts-tongue*, and of all that *Tribe*, are *Slung* or
*Shot* away. The doing of which is performed by the curious contrivance
of the *Seed-Case*; as in *Codded Arsmart*, and some other like
*Plants*. Only there, the *Spring* moves and curles up inward; but here
it moves outward. I shall describe it, as well as the *Weather* (which
when I observed it was cloudy) would permit. Every *Seed-Case*, as
it appears through a good *Glass*, *Tab. 72.* stands upon a *Pedicle* from ½ an Inch
to an Inch or more in Length; at the bottom about as thick again as a
*Horse-hair*, and a little thicker at the *Top*, on which stands the *Case*, of
a *Silver Colour*; about the bigness of a *Cherry-Stone*, of a *Spherick Figure*,
and girded about with a sturdy *Tendon* or *Spring*, of the
*Colour* of *Gold*: the whole *Machine* looking not much unlike a little
*Padlock*. The *Surface* of the *Spring* resembles a fine *Screw*, or some of
the *Aer-Vessels* in the *Wood* of a *Plant*. So soon as by the *Innate Aer* of
the *Plant*, or otherwise, this *Spring* is become stark enough, it suddenly
breaks the *Case* into two halfs, like two little *Cups*, and so slings
the *Seed*.

8. §. These *Cases* grow in oblique *Furrows* or *Trenches* on the back
side the *Leaf*, from ¼ of an Inch to an Inch in Length, and about ⅛ᵗʰ
of an Inch broad. *Tab. 72.* In one of these *Trenches* an Inch long are more than
300 of the *Cases* above described; and allowing but 10 *Seeds* to every
*Case*, above 3000 *Seeds*. Which being multiplied by the number of
*Furrows* in one *Leaf*, with allowance for the lesser *Furrows*; and that
summ by the number of *Leaves* commonly growing upon one *Root*,
comes to above Ten Hundred Thousand *Seeds*, the annual product of
this *Plant*. The *Seed* is of a *Tawny Colour*, through a good *Glass* about
1/12ᵗʰ of an Inch long, flat, and somewhat oval. Of these, ten Thousand
are not so big as a white *Pepper Corn*.
