### CHAP. V.

### Of the FLOWER.

![W](images/i_drop_w_075.jpg)

E next proceed to the *Flower*. The general *Parts*
whereof are most commonly three; *sc.* the *Empalement*,
the *Foliation*, and the *Attire*.

2. §. The *Empalement*, whether of one or more
pieces, I call that which is the utmost *Part* of the
*Flower*, encompassing the other two. ’Tis compounded
of the three general *Parts*, the *Skin*, the
*Cortical* and *Lignous Bodies*, each *Empaler* (where there are divers)
being as another little *Leaf*; as in those of a *Quince-Flower*, as oft
as they happen to be overgrown, is well seen. As likewise in the
*Primrose*, with the *green Flower*; commonly so call’d, though by a
mistake: For that which seems to be the *Flower*, is only the more
flourishing *Empalement*, the *Flower* it self being *White*. But the continuation
of all the three aforesaid *Parts* into each *Empaler*, is discoverable,
I think, no where better than in an *Artichoke*, which is a
true *Flower*, and whose *Empalers* are of that amplitude, as fairly to
shew them all: As also, that the Original of the *Skin* of each *Empaler*
or *Leaf* is not distinct from that of the rest; but to be all one piece,
laid in so many *Plaits* or *Duplicatures*, as there are *Leaves*, from the
outermost to the inner and most Central ones.

3. §. The Design of the *Empalement*, is to be *Security* and *Bands*
to the other two *Parts* of the *Flower*: To be their *Security* before its
opening, by intercepting all extremities of *Weather*: Afterwards to be
their *Bands*, and firmly to contain all their *Parts* in their due and
most decorous posture: so that a *Flower* without its *Empalement*,
would hang as uncouth and taudry, as a *Lady* without her *Bodies*.

4. §. Hence we have the reason why it is various, and sometimes
wanting. Some *Flowers* have none, as *Tulips*; for having a fat and
firm *Leaf*, and each *Leaf* likewise standing on a broad and strong *Basis*,
they are thus sufficient to themselves. *Carnations*, on the contrary,
have not only an *Empalement*, but that (for more firmitude)
of one piece: For otherwise, the Foot of each *Leaf* being very long
and slender, most of them would be apt to break out of compass:
yet is the top of the *Empalement* indented also; that the *Indentments*,
by being lapp’d over the *Leaves* before their expansion, may then
protect them; and by being spread under them afterwards, may better
shoulder and prop them up. And if the Feet of the *Leaves* be
both long and very tender too, here the *Empalement* is numerous,
though consisting of several pieces; yet those in divers *Rounds*, and
all with a counterchangeable respect to each other (which also the
Learned Sir *Thomas Brown* observes) Treat. of the *Quincunx*. as in all *Knapweeds*, and other
*Flowers*; whereby, how commodious they are for both the aforesaid
ends, may easily be conceiv’d; and well enough exemplified by the
Scales of *Fishes*, whereunto, as to their position, they have not an
unapt resemblance.

5. §. THE FOLIATION also, is of the same substantial *Nature*
with the green *Leaf*; the *Membrane*, *Pulp*, and *Fibres* whereof, being,
as there, so here, but the continuation of the *Skin*, the *Cortical*
and *Lignous Bodies*.

6. §. The *Foulds* of the *Flower* or *Foliation* are various, as those
of the green *Leaf*; but some of them different. The most general
are, First, The *Close-Couch*, as in *Roses*, and many other double *Flowers*.
Then the *Concave-Couch*, as in *Blattaria flore albo*. Next the
*Plait*, as in some of the *Leaves* of *Pease-Blooms*, in the *Flowers* of *Coriander*,
&c. which is either single, as in those nam’d; or double, as in
*Blew-Bottle*, *Jacea*, and more of that rank. Next, the *Couch*, and
*Plait* together in the same *Flower*, as in *Marigolds*, *Daisies*, and all
others of an agreeing form: where the first apparent *Fould* or *Composture*
of the *Leaves* is in *Couch*; but the *Leaves* being erect, each
likewise may be seen to lie in a double *Plait* within it self. Then
the *Rowl*, as in the *Flowers* of *Ladies-Bower*, the broad top of each
*Leaf* being by a double *Rowl* foulded up inwardly. Next, the *Spire*,
which is the beginning of a *Rowl*; and may be seen in the *Flowers*
of *Mallows*, and others. Lastly, the *Plait* and *Spire* together, where
the *Part* analogous to the *Foliation*, is of one piece, the *Plaits* being
here laid, and so carried on by *Spiral Lines* to the top of the *Flower*,
as is in divers, and I think, in *Convolvulus Doronici folio*, more elegantly
seen. These and other *Foulds*, See in the *Figures* belonging
to the *Second* **Part** of the *Fourth* **Book**. The reason of all which
varieties, a comparative consideration of the several *Parts* of the
*Flower* may suggest. I’le only mention, That no *Flower*, that I find,
hath a *Back-Rowl*, as hath the green *Leaf*. For two Reasons; because
its *Leaves* have not their *Fibres* standing out much on their backside,
as the green *Leaves* have; and because of its *Attire*, which it ever embosomes,
and cannot so well do it by a *Back-Rowl*.

7. §. The usual *Protections* of *Flowers* by the Precedents are express’d,
*sc.* *Green Leaves* and *Empalements*. Some have another more
peculiar, that is a *double Veil*; as the *Spring-Crocus*. For having no
*Empalement*, and starting up early out of the *Mould*, even before its *Green
Leaves*, and that upon the first opening of the Spring; lest it should
thus be quite starved, ’tis born swath’d up in a double *Blanket*, or
with a pair of *Sheets* upon its *Back*.

8. §. The *Leaves* of divers *Flowers* at their *Basis* have an *hairy
Tuft*; by which *Tufts* the Concave of the *Empalement* is filled up;
That, being very choice and tender, they may thus be kept in a gentle
and constant Warmth, as most convenient for them.

9. §. The *Leaves* of the *Flower*, though they are not hairy all
over, yet in some particular parts they are often set with a fine
Downy *Velvet*; that, being by their shape and posture in those
parts contiguous to their delicate and tender *Attire*, they may thus
give it a more soft and warmer touch. Thus in the *Flower* of *Ladies
Bower*, those parts of its *Leaves* which rowl inward, and lie contiguous
to the *Attire*, are Downy; whereas the other *Parts* are smooth or
bald: So the *Flowers* of *Pease*, *Spanish Broom*, *Toad-Flax*, and many
others, where contiguous to their *Attires*, are deck’d with the like
*Hairy Velvet*.

10. §. As upon the Green *Leaves*, so upon the *Flowers* are
*Globulets* somtimes seen; as upon the backside of that of *Enula*. On
none more plainly than that kind of *Blattaria* with the white *Flower*;
where they are all transparent, and growing both on the *Stalk* and
*Leaves* of the *Flower*, each shewing likewise its *Peduncle* whereon it
is erected.

11. §. The use of the *Flower*, or the *Foliation* whereof we now
speak, (that is, as to its private service) is for the protection of
the *Attire*; *This*, as its under, and the *Empalement* as its upper Garments.
As likewise of the *Fruit*: The necessity of which Service, in
some Cases, by the different situation of the *Flower* and *Fruit*, with
respect to each other, is evident; *Apples*, *Pears*, and several other
*Fruits*, standing behind or under the *Flower*; but *Cherries*, *Aprecots*,
and divers others, within it. For these, being of a very tender and
pulpous Body, and withal putting forth with the colder part of the
Spring; could not weather it out against the Variations and Extremities
of the Air, (as those of a more solid *Parenchyma* can) except
lodged up within their *Flowers*.

12. §. And as the *Flower* is serviceable to the safety of the
*Fruit*, so is it to its growth; *sc.* in its Infancy, or *Embryo*-estate;
for which purpose, as there is a *Flower*, so that *Flower* is greater or
less, according as the nature of the *Fruit* to which it belongs, and
the plenty of the *Sap* by which the *Fruit* is fed, doth require.
Thus, where the young *Fruit* is of a solider Substance and the ascent
of the *Sap* less copious, were there here no *Flower* to promote the
said ascent thereof into the *Fruit* (in the manner as is effected by the
Green *Leaves*) it must needs pine and die, or prove less kindly. On
the contrary, should the *Flower* be over-large, it would not only
promote the ascent of the *Sap* up to the *Fruit*, but being as yet over-proportionate
to it, would likewise it self exhaust the same *Sap*, as
fast as ascendent; like a greedy Nurse, that prepares the Meat for her
Child, and then eats it up her self. Thus we see *Apples* and *Pears*,
with a *Flower* of a moderate *Size*; like their *Body*, of a middle Constitution,
and their *Sap*, of a middle quantity: But *Quinces*, being
more solid, besides that they have as great a *Flower*, the *Impalers* of
their *Flower* also thrive so far as to become handsom *Leaves*; continuing
also after the *Flower* is fallen, firm and verdent a great while;
so long, till the *Fruit* be able to provide for it self. On the other
hand, *Plums* being more tender and Sappy than *Apples* and *Pears*, besides
that their *Empalers* are much alike, their *Flower* is less, and *Goosberries*
and *Currants*, which are still more Pulpy, and the course of the
*Sap* towards them more free, have yet a *Flower* far less. And *Grapes*,
whose *Sap* is still of quicker Ascent, have scarce any *Flower* at all;
only some small resemblance thereof, serving just upon the setting of
the *Fruit*, and no longer.

13. §. THE ATTIRE, I find to be of two kinds, *Seminiforme*,
and *Florid*. That which I call *Seminiforme*, is made up of two general
*Parts*, *Chives* and *Semets*, one upon each *Chive*. These *Semets* (as I
take leave to call them) have the appearance, especially in many
*Flowers*, of so many little *Seeds*: but are quite another kind of *Body*.
For, upon enquiry, we find, that these *Semets*, though they seem to

be solid, and for some time after their first formation, are entire; yet
are they really hollow; and their side, or sides, which were at first
entire, at length crack asunder: And that moreover the *Concave* of
each *Semet* is not a meer vacuity, but fill’d up with a number of minute
Particles, in form of a *Powder*. Which, though common to all *Semets*,
yet in some, and particularly those of a *Tulip* or a *Lilly*, being larger,
is more distinctly observable. *Tab. 4. f. 12.*

14. §. These *Semets* are somtimes fastned so, as to stand erect
above their *Chive*, as those of *Larks-heel*. Somtimes, and I think usually,
so as to hang a little down by the midle, in the manner and figure
of a *Kidney*; as in *Mallows*. Their *Cleft* or *Crack* is sometimes single,
but for the most part double: At these *Clefts* it is that they disburse
their *Powders*; *f. 12.* a. which as they start out, and stand betwixt the two
Lips of each *Cleft*, have some resemblance to the common Sculpture
of a *Pomegranate* with its *Seeds* looking out at the *Cleft* of its *Rind*.
This must be observ’d when the *Clefts* are recently made, which usually
is before the expansion of the *Flower*.

15. §. The Particles of these *Powders*, though like those of
Meal or other Dust, they appear not easily to have any regular shape;
yet upon strict observation, especially with the assistance of an indifferent
*Glass*, it doth appear, That they are a *Congeries*, usually, of
so many perfect *Globes* or *Globulets*; Sometimes of other *Figures*, but
always regular. That which obscures their *Figure* is their being so
small: In *Dogs-Mercury*, *Borage*, and very many more *Plants*, they
are extreamly so. In *Mallows*, and some others, more fairly visible.

16. §. Some of these *Powders*, are *yellow*, as in *Dogs-Mercury*,
*Goats-Rue*, &c. and some of other Colours: But most of them I
think are *white*; and those of *yellow Henbane* very elegant; the disburs’d
*Powders* whereof, to the naked eye, are *white* as *Snow*; but each
*Globulet*, through a Glass, transparent as Crystal; which is not a
fallacy from the *Glass*, but what we see in all transparent *Bodies* whatsoever,
lying in a *Powder* or small Particles together. The Parts of
this *Attire*, see in *Tab. 4.* But especially, in the *Figures* belonging
to the *Second* **Part** of the *Fourth* **Book**.

17. §. The *Florid Attire*, is commonly known by the blind and
rude Name of *Thrums*; as in the *Flowers* of *Marigold*, *Tansie*, &c.
How inadequate its imposition is, observation will determine. For the
several *Thrums* or rather *Suits*, whereof the *Attire* is made up, however
else they may differ in various *Flowers*, in this agree, that they
are ever consistent of more than one, sometimes of Two, *Tab. 4. f. 13.* a. and for
the most part of Three *Pieces* (for which I call them *Suits*) and each
*Piece* of a different, but agreeable and comely form.

18. §. The *outer Part* of every *Suit*, is its *Floret*: whose *Body*
or *Tube* is divided at the top (like that of the *Cowslip*) into five
distinct *Leaves*. *f. 13.* b. So that a *Floret*, is the Epitome of a *Flower*: and
is all the *Flower* that many *Plants*, as *Mugwort*, *Tansie*, and others,
have. What the Learned Sir *Thomas Brown* observeth Treat. of the *Quincunx*. of the
number *Five*, as to the *Leaves* of the *Flower*, is still more universally
holding in these of the *Floret*.

19. §. Upon the Expansion of the *Floret*, the next *Part* of the
*Suit* is from within its *Tube* brought to sight; which we may (with respect
to that within it) call the *Sheath*. *f. 13.* c. For this also, like the *Floret*,

is a *Concave Body*; in its shape very well resembling the Fistulous
Pouches of *Wake-Robin*, or of *Dragon*.

20. §. The *Sheath*, after some time, dividing at the top, from
within its Concave the Third and innermost part of the *Suit*, *sc.* the
*Blade* advanceth and displayes it self. *Tab. 4. f. 13.* d. This Part is not hollow, as
the other two, but solid; yet at its Point, is commonly, divided into
two halves.

21. §. About the said Point especially, there appears, *Globulets*,
which are of the same nature with those of a *Semet*, though not so
copious. So that all *Flowers* have their *Powders* or *Globulets*. The
whole *Attire* may in *Aster Per*, *Blewbottle*, &c. where the *Suits* are
large, be plainly observed without a *Glass*. The *Parts* of this *Attire*,
See in *Tab. 4.* But especially in the *Figures* belonging to the *Second*
**Part** of the *Fourth* **Book**.

22. §. The use of the *Attire*, how contemptibly soever we may
look upon it, is certainly great. And though for our own use we
value the *Leaves* of the *Flower*, or the *Foliation*, most; yet of all
the three *Parts*, this in some respects is the choycest, as for whose
sake and service the other two are made. The use hereof, as to
*Ornament* and *Distinction*, is unquestionable; but is not all. As for
Distinction, though, by the help of *Glasses*, we may make it to extend
far; yet in a passant view, which is all we usually make, we
cannot so well. As for Ornament, and particularly in reference to the
*Semets*, we may ask, If for that meerly these were meant, then why
should they be so made as to break open, or to contain any thing
within them? Since their Beauty would be as good if they were not
hollow; and is better before they crack and burst open, than afterwards.

23. §. Other uses hereof therefore we must acknowledge, and
may observe. One is, for food; for Ornament and Distinction to
us, and for *Food* to other *Animals*. I will not say, but that it may serve
even to these for Distinction too, that they may be able to know one
*Plant* from another, and in their flight or progress settle where they
like best: and that therefore the varieties of these small parts are many,
and well observed by them, which we take no notice of. Yet the
finding out of Food is but in order to enjoy it: Which, that it is
provided for a vast number of little *Animals* in the *Attires* of all
*Flowers*, observation perswades us to believe. For why else are they
evermore here found? Go from one *Flower* to another, great and
small, you shall meet with none untaken up with these Guests. In
some, and particularly the *Sun-Flower*, where the parts of the *Attire*,
and the *Animals* for which they provide, are larger, the matter is more
visible. We must not think, that *God Almighty* hath left any of the
whole Family of his Creatures unprovided for; but as the Great
Master, some where or other carveth out to all; and that for a
great number of these little Folk, He hath stored up their peculiar
provisions in the *Attires* of *Flowers*; each *Flower* thus becoming their
Lodging and their Dining-Room, both in one.

24. §. Wherein the particular parts of the *Attire* may be more distinctly
serviceable, this to one *Animal*, and that to another, I cannot
say: Or to the same *Animal*, as a *Bee*, whether this for the *Honey*, another
for their *Bread*, a third for the *Wax*: Or whether all only suck

from hence some *Juice*; or some may not also carry some of the *Parts*,
as of the *Globulets*, wholly away.

25. §. Or lastly, what may be the Primary and Private Use of
the *Attire* (for even this abovesaid, though great, yet is but Secondary)
I now determine not.
