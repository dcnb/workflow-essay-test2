### Of the Attire, and first of that sort which may be called
    Seminiform.

ITHIN
the *Foliature* stands the *Attire*; which is
of Two general *Kinds*, every where Various and
Elegant; according to the *Description* I have given
of them in the *First* **Book**. *Ch. 5.* I shall here add some
further *Remarques*.

2. §. And first, of that Sort of *Attire*, which
may be called *Seminiform*; being usually, as it
were, a little *Sheaf* of *Seed-like Particles*; standing on so many *Pedicills*,
as the *Ear* doth upon the *End* of the *Straw*.

3. §. Of their *Colour* it is observable, That for the most part, they
are *White* or *Yellow*; sometimes *Blew*; but never *Red*, let the *Flower*
or *Foliature* be of what *Colour* it will. Neither doth their *Colour* always
follow that of the *Foliature*, although that be not *Red*. Whereby
it appears, how very Curious and Critical *Nature* is, in the *Separation*
of the *Juyces* in *Plants*: that such small *Parts* as these of the *Attire*,
and so near the *Leaves* of the *Flower*, should yet receive a different
*Tincture*.

4. §. These *Parts* differ also in their *Position*; standing sometimes
double upon each *Pedicil*, as in *Toad-flax*, *Snapdragon*, and some others; *Tab. 55.*
but usually single, as in *Blattaria*, *Clematis Austriaca*, &c. Sometimes
fastned to their *Pedicils* at their middle, stooping down after the manner
of *Poppy* and other hanging *Flowers*; as in *Spanish-Broom*, *Hysop*,
*Scabeous*, *Behen*, &c. Sometimes they stand erected, as in *Clematis
Austriaca*, *Ladyes-Looking-Glass*, *Rape-Crowfoot*, &c. Those of *Coded
Arsmart* have no *Pedicils*, but stand upon a large *Base*.

5. §. Of the *Pedicils* themselves, it is to be noted, That they are
rarely fastned to the *Top* of the *Repository* or *Case* of the *Seed*, but
round about the *Bottom*. *Partly*, That hereby they may the better intercept
and separate the *Incongruous Parts* of the *Sap* from the *Seed*.
Yet in the *Coded Arsmart* they stand at the *Top*. Which is not the only
thing peculiar in that *Plant*; it being the property thereof, to ejaculate
its *Seed*, upon the least touch. Which property seemeth to depend,
*partly*, upon the *Position* of the said *Pedicils*, as shall be shewed
in speaking of the *Seed*.

6. §. These *Seed-like Parts* are also of different *Number*. In *Great
Celandine*, *Rose*, *Rape-Crowfoot*, numerous; in *Great Plantaine*, and
some other *Herbs*, much more conspicuous than the *Foliature* it self. In
*Germander-Chickweed*, they are always *Two*, and no more. Sometimes
they follow the number of the *Leaves*, especially in the number 5; as
in *Blattaria*, *Black Henbean*, &c. In *Stichwort* and *Lychnis Sylvestris*,
they are 10, just double to the number of the *Leaves*.

7. §. They differ also in their *Bigness*, being in some smaller *Flowers*,
large; as in *Borage*, *Ladys-Looking-Glass*, and others: and in some
larger *Flowers*, less; as in the *Rose*.

8. §. But especially in their *Shape*, which is always very Elegant,
and with much Variety. In *Borage*, like the point of a *Spear*. In *Blattaria*,
like a *Horse-shooe*. In *Clematis Austriaca*, like the *Spatula*, wherewith
*Apothecaries* make their *Mixtures*. In *Mallow*, like a *Head-Roll*.
In *Hysop*, they have one *Cleft* before; in *Blattaria*, one round about;
in *Water Bettony*, one at the *Top*; in *Scabious*, they have a double *Cleft*,
one on each side; *Tab. 56.* and so in St. *Johns Wort*, *Hyoscyamus*, and others;
before they open, in the *Shape* of a double *Purse*.

9. §. These *Parts*, are all hollow; each being the *Theca* or *Case*
of a great many extream small *Particles*, either *Globular*, or otherwise
*Convex*; but always regularly *figur’d*. They are all crowded together,
and fastned in close *Ranks*, without any *Pedicils*, to the Insides of the
*Theca*, like other lesser *Seeds* within a greater; or after the same manner
as in *Hyoscyamus* and some other *Plants*, the true *Seeds* themselves
grow all round about close to the *Bed* of the *Case*; as in *Clary*, and
the *Figures* now referred to, may be seen. *Tab. 55, 56.* And when they are ripe, the
*Case* also opens and admits them to the *Aer*, as the *Seed-Case* doth the
*Seed*. The whole *Attire*, together with the *Foliature* and *Seed-Case*,
*Tab. 57.*See in one Example, amongst the *Figures*.

10. §. The *Colour* of these small *Particles* conteined in the *Theca*,
is also different. But as That is usually *White* or *Yellow*, so are These:
sometimes *Blewish*; but never *Red*. And sometimes not of the same
*Colour* with that of the *Theca*. Which further shews how scrupulous
*Nature* is, in differencing the *Tinctures* of the several *Parts*.

11. §. They are also of different *Bigness* and *Figure*. Those in
*Snap-dragon*, are of the smallest *Size* I have seen; *Tab. 58.* being no bigger
through a good *Microscope*, than the least *Cheese-Mite* to the naked
Eye. In *Plantain*, also through a *Glass*, like a *Scurvy-grass-seed*. In
*Bears-foot*, like a *Mustard-seed*. In *Carnation*, like a *Turnep-Seed*. In
*Bindweed*, like a *Peper-Corn*. In all these of a *Globular Figure*.

12. §. In *Devils-bit*, they are also *Round*, but depressed, like the *Seed*
of *Goos-grass*, or a *Holland Cheese*. In the *Bean* and all sorts of *Puls*,
and *Trefoyls*, as also in *Blew-bottle*, &c. they are *Cylindrick*. *Tab. 58.* In *Orange
Lilly*, *Oval*, one 5ᵗʰ of an Inch long, like an *Ants-Egg*. In *Deadly-Nightshade*,
also *Oval*, but smaller at both Ends. And those of *Pancy*, *Cubick*.
In all these and the former, they are *Smooth*.

13. §. But in *Mallow*, *Holyoak*, and all of that kind, they are beset
round about with little *Thornes*; whereby each looks like the *Seed-Ball*
of *Roman Nettle*, or like the *Fruit* of *Thorn-Apple*, or the *Fish* called
*Piscis orbis minor*, or the *Murices*, used antiently in *Wars*. *Tab. 58.* They are
also very great, shewing, through a *Glass*, of the bigness of a large
*White Pease*; being 200 or 300 times biger than those in *Snapdragon*;
of which there are about a *Thousand* in each *Theca*, that is, in the space
of about 1000ᵗʰ *Cubical Part* of an Inch.

14. §. In some *Plants*, as in *Deadly Night-shade*, where these *Particles*
are *White*, they seem, by a very good *Glass* and advantagious *Position*,
to be composed of *Parenchymous* and *Lignous Fibres*, stitched up
together, as in the other *Parts*.

15. §. In *Colocynthis*, (and with some *Analogy* in *Wild Cucumer*,
and I suppose all of that kind) the *Attire* is very peculiar, not consisting
of several little *Thecæ*, upon so many *Pedicils*, as is described; but
is all one entire *Part*, like a thick *Columna* in the midst of the *Flower*;
having several little *Ridges*, and *Furrows* winding from the *Top* to the
*Bottom* round about. In the midle of each *Ridge* runs a *Line*, where
the *Skin*, after sometime, openeth into two *Lips*, presenting the *Globular
Particles* conteined in the hollow of every *Ridge*.

16. §. Where the *Attire* consists of several *Seed-like Parts*, as is
described there, another *Part* distinct, like a little *Columna* or *Pinacle*,
stands on the *Top* of the *Uterus* or true *Seed-Case*. Which is
also regularly and variously *Figured*. In *Bindweed*, it hath a round
*Head*, like that of a great *Pin*. *Tab. 56, 57.* In the *Common Bell*, St. *Johns wort*, it is
divided into *Three Parts*. In *Geranium*, into *Five*; In *Asarum*, into
*Six*. Sometimes, the *Head is Smooth*, and sometimes beset with little
*Thorns*, as in *Hyoscyamus*. Of the *Use* of these *Parts*, anon.
