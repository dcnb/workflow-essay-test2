### CHAP. III.

### Of the NATURE of Mixture.

![A](images/i_drop_a_182.jpg)
ND
 first of all, from the *Premisses*, we arrive at this
*Conclusion*; *sc.* That the *Formation* and *Transformation*
of all Bodies, can be nothing else, but the *Mixture*
of Bodies. For all *Principles* are *immutable*;
 *Ch. 2. §. 3.* as we
have above proved: and therefore not *generable*,
*formable*, or *transformable*. And the *Forms* of *Principles*,
being but their *Modes*, are also *immutable*.
 *Ch. 2. §. 10.*
So that the whole *Business* of the *Material World*, is nothing else, but
*Mixture*.

2. §. Again, as *Nature* worketh every where only by *Mixture*;
so is this *Mixture* every where but *one thing*, and can be but *one*. For
whether it be the *Mixture* of *great* Bodies, or of *small*; of *Compounds*,
or of *Atomes*; it is every where *Mixture*, and the *Mixture* of *Bodies*.
 *Ch. 2. §. 2.*
Wherefore, *Mixture* is either an *intelligible Affection* of *all* Bodies, or
of *none*; which later, no man will say. As many ways therefore, as
we can *see*, or *conceive* the *Mixture* of any *gross* Bodies, which we
hold in our hand; so many ways, we may, of the *subtilest Mixtures*
which *Nature* maketh, or of *Atomes* themselves; and no other ways.

3. §. Now all the ways we can distinguish *Mixture* by, are, in general,
these *Two*; either in respect of the *Bodies Mixed*, or else of the
*Modes* of the *Mixture* it self.

4. §. In respect of the *Bodies Mixed*, *Mixture* is distinguished also
*two* ways; *viz.* by *Conjugation*, and by *Proportion*.

5. §. By *Conjugation*, I mean, a *Mixture of some certain Principles,
and not of others*. Which is *threefold*. *First*, As to *Number*:
as when one Body may be compounded of *two Principles*, another of
*three*, a third of *four*, a fourth of *five*, and so on. *Secondly*, As to
*Kind*: where, though there be a conjunction of the same *Number*,
yet not of the same *Kind*. *Thirdly*, When they differ from one another
both in *Number* and *Kind*. So many ways the *Principles* of
Bodies may be conceived to be *Conjugated*; and therefore are:
for here, that which *may* be, *is*. The Consequence is clear. For
*first*, *Nature* hath various *Materials* wherewith to make these *Mixtures*;
as we have shewed. *Ch. 2. §. 5.* *Secondly*, By these *Mixtures* she *may*, and
without the concurrence of any imaginary *Forms*, *must* produce all the
varieties in the *material World*; as likewise hath been said.
 *Ch. 3. §. 1.* Wherefore,
since all imaginable *Mixtures may* be *made*, and that to *some purpose*;
if they should not be *so*, *Nature* would be *Imperfect*: because
we our selves can think, how she might put her *Materials* to further
use, then *so* she would do. To think therefore, that all *Kinds* of *Principles*,
or all *Elements* go to make up every *Compounded Body*, as by the
*Peripatetick Philosophy* we are taught; is a conceit, no more to be
credited, than one that should tell us, all *Kind* of *Wheels* and other

*parts* of a *Watch*, were put into a *Clock*; or that there were no other
*Materials* wherewith to build an *House*, then for a *Tent* or a *Ship*. For
why should *Nature*, the great *Artificer* by which all *perfect Works* are
made, be feigned to cram and ram *all things into one*, which we our
selves look upon as absurd?

6. §. *Secondly*, The *Mixture* of *Principles* is diversifi’d, as by *Conjugation*,
so also by *Proportion*. That is, by the divers *Quantities*, of
the several *Principles* or *Parts mixed* together. As if the *Quantity* of
one, were as *five* to *ten*; of a second, as *five* to *fifteen*; of a third, as
*five* to *twenty*, &c. Or if that of one, be as *five* to *six*; of a second,
as *six* to *seven*; of a third, as *seven* to *eight*. By which, and by other
*Proportions*, *Mixture* may be varied innumerable ways.

7. §. *Again*, As *Mixture* is varied with respect to the *Bodies Mixed*;
so likewise in respect of the *Mixture* it self, which I call the *Location*
of *Principles*, or the *Modes* of their *Conjunction*. Which may be
various, as well as their *Conjugation* and *Proportion*. Yet are they all
reduceable unto *two* general *Modes*:
 *Ch. 2. §. 2.* all *Bodies*, and therefore all *Principles*,
being *mixed* either by *Mediation*, or by *Contact*.

8. §. Now all *Contact*, whether of *Compounds*, or of *Atomes*, can
be no other way, than such as is answerable to their *Figures*. Whereof,
therefore, we can conceive but *three* general ways, *viz.*

*First*, By *Contact* in a *Point*, or some *smaller part*: as when *two Atomes*
meet, which are *globular* or otherwise *gibbose*. *Secondly*, By
*Contact* in a *Plain*: as in the conjunction of the *sides* of *Triangular* or
*Quadrangular Atomes*, or otherwise *flat*. *Thirdly*, By *Contact* in a
*Concave*: as when one *Atome* is admitted into the *Concave* or *hole* of
another; as a Spigot is into a Fosset. The *first* may be called, *Apposition*;
the *second*, *Application*; the *third*, *Reception* or *Intrusion*.

9. §. In the *two last* ways, *Atomes* may be joyned by *Mediation*;
but best of all the *last*. As when the *two extreams* of one *Atome* are received
into the *Concaves* or the *holes* of two others.

10. §. And these are all the *general* ways, whereby we can conceive
Bodies to be *Mixed* together; *sc.* by their various *Conjugation*, *Proportion*
and *Location*. So that the *Composition* of *Atomes*, in *Bodies*; is
like that of *Letters*, in *Words*. What a Thunderclap would such a
*Word* be, wherein all the four and twenty *Letters* were pack’d up?
One therefore is compounded of more, another of fewer: this of some,
and that of others: and both the *Conjugation*, *Proportion*, and *Location*
of *Letters* is varied in every *Word*: whereby, we have many thousands
of *differing Words*, without any *alteration* at all, in the *Letters
themselves*; and might have ten times as many more. In like manner,
therefore, or in the self same analogous way, as the *Letters* of the *Alphabet*,
are the *Principles* of *Words*; so *Principles*, are the *Alphabet* of
*Things*.

11. §. What we have said of *Principles*; and of *Mixture* as consequent
thereupon; may be a *foundation* for an *intelligible* account, of
the *Nature* and *Cause* of most of the Intrinsick *Properties*, and *Qualities*
of *Bodies*: as of *Gravity*, *Levity*, *Fixity*, *Fluidity*, *Angularity*, *Roundness*,
*Heat*, *Cold*, *Blackness*, *Whiteness*, *Sowerness*, *Sweetness*, *Fragrancy*,
*Fetidness*, and very many more. I say an *intelligible* account; *sc.*
such as is grounded upon the *Notions* of *Sense*, and made out *Mechanically*.
But the exemplification hereof, being too large a field

for this, or any one *Lecture*, I shall, before I come to the *Causes* of
*Mixture*, only deduce from the *Premises*, these following *Corollaries*.

12. §. *First*, That there is no *alteration* of *Principles* or of *Elements*,
in the most *perfect Mixture* of Bodies. It *cannot* be; for *Principles*
are *Immutable*, as we have said.
 *Ch. 2. §. 3.* And if it could be, yet it *needeth not*
to be: for they are also *many*, and *compoundable infinite* ways;
 *Ch. 2. §. 5.* as
hath been shewed. So that we have no need to perplex our selves
with any of those difficulties,
 *Ch. 3. §. 10.* that arise from the *Doctrine* of the
*Alteration* of *Elements*. The ground of which conceit, is that, of
there being but four *Elements*, and all in every particle of the
*mixed Body*. And so men being puzeled, how from thence to make
out the infinite *variety* of Bodies, they feigned them to be alterable,
and *altered*, upon every *perfect Mixture*. Not considering, that if
their four *Elements* be *alterable*; as few as they are, no fewer then
*three* of them may be spared: for *one Element*, if *alterable*, may be made
*any*.

13. §. Hence, *Secondly*, may be solved that great *Dispute*, Whether
such as we call *Lixivial Salts*, are *made* by the *fire*? For *first*,
No *Principle* is made by the *fire*:
 *Ch. 2. §. 3.* all *Principles* being *unalterable*;
and therefore *unmakable*. *Secondly*, We must therefore distinguish
betwixt the *Principle*, and its various *Mixture* with other *Principles*;
from whence it may receive different *Shapes* and *Names*. Wherefore,
a *Lixivial Salt*, *qua Lixivial*, is certainly *made* by the *fire*. But *quatenus
Salt*, it is not: that *Principle* being *extractable* out of *most* Bodies;
and by *divers* other *ways*, then by the *fire*. For whether you
*Calcine* a body, or else *Ferment* it, (after the manner shewed by the
*curious Improver* of *Chymical* Knowledge, *Dr. Daniel Cox*) or *putrifie*
it under ground, or *drown* it in the Sea; it still yieldeth *some kind*
of *Salt*. All which *Salts* are *made*, not by *making* the *Saline Principle*;
but only by its being differently *Mixed*, by those several ways
of the *Solution* of Bodies, with other *Principles*: from which its different
*Mixture*, it receives the *various Denominations*, of *Marine*, *Nitrous*,
*Volatile*, or *Lixivial*.

14. §. Hence, *Thirdly*, the most *perfect Mixture* of Bodies, can
go no higher than *Contact*. For all *Principles* are *unalterable*;
 *Ch. 2. §. 3.* and all
*Matter* is *impenetrable*; as hath been said.
 *Ch. 3. §. 2.* In the most *visible* and *laxe
Mixture*, there is *Contact*; and in the most *subtile* and *perfect*, as in *Generation*
it self, there is *nothing more*.

15. §. Hence, *Fourthly*, we easily understand, how divers of the
same *Principles*, belonging both to *Vegetables* and many *other* Bodies,
are also *actually* existent in the Body of *Man*. Because even in *Generation*
or *Transmutation*, the *Principles* which are translated from one
Body to another, as from a *Vegetable* to an *Animal*, are not in the least
*alter’d* in themselves; but only their *Mixture*, that is, their *Conjugation*,
*Proportion* and *Location*, is *varied*.

16. §. Hence also the difference of *Mixture*, arising from the difference
of *Contact*, is intelligible; *sc.* as to those *three degrees*, *Congregation*,
*Union*, and *Concentration*.

*Congregation*, and *Inconsistent Mixture*, is when the several *Atomes*
touch but in a *Point*, or *smaller part*.
 *Ch. 3. §. 8.* In *which* manner, I have divers
arguments, inducing me to believe the *Atomes* of all *Fluid Bodies*, *qua
Fluid*, do touch; and in *no other*.

*Ch. 3. §. 8.*
 *Union*, is when they touch in a *Plain*. As in the *Crystals* and *Shootings*
of all *Salts*, and *other* like Bodies. For if we pursue their divided
and subdivided parts, with our eye, as far as we can; they still
*terminate*, on every side, in *Plains*. Wherefore, ’tis intelligible, That
their very *Atomes* do also *terminate*, and therefore *touch*, in *Plain*.

*Concentration*, is when two, or more *Atomes* touch by *Reception*
and *Intrusion* of one into another:
 *Ch. 3. §. 8.* which is the *closest*, and *firmest
Mixture* of all; as in any *fixed unodorable*, or *untastable* Body: the
*Atomes* of such Bodies, being not able to make any *Smell* or *Taste*,
unless they were first *dissolved*; that is to say, *unpin’d* one from
another.

17. §. Hence, *Sixthly*, we understand, how in some cases, there
seemeth to be a *Penetration* of *Bodies*; and in what *sense* it may be
admitted: *viz.* if we will mean no more by *Penetration*, but *Intrusion*.
For the *Intrusion* of one *Atome* into the *Concave* or *hole* of another,
is a *kind* of *Penetration*; whereby they take up less room in
the *mixed* Body, then they would do by any other way of *Contact*.
As a naked knife and its sheath, take up almost double room, to what
they do, when the knife is sheathed. Whence we may assign the
*reason*, Why many *Liquors* being *mixed*; take up less room or space,
then they did *apart*; as the *Ingenious* Mr. *Hook* hath made it to appear
by *Experiment*, that they do. I say the plain *reason* hereof, or at least
one reason, is the *Intrusion* of many of their *Atomes* into one another.
Which yet is not a *Penetration* of Bodies strictly so called.

18. §. *Seventhly*, If all that *Nature maketh*, be but *Mixture*;
 *Ch. 3. §. 1.* and
all this *Mixture* be but *Contact* ’tis then evident, That *Natural* and
*Artificial* Mixture, are the *same*.
 *Ch. 3. §. 14.* And all those *seeming subtilties*
whereby *Philosophers* have gone about to *distinguish* them; have
been but so many *Scarcrows* to affright *Men* from the *Imitation*
of *Nature*.

19. §. *Eighthly*, Hence it follows, That *Art* it self may go far in
doing what *Nature* doth. And who can say, how far? For we have
nothing to *Make*; but only to *mix* those *Materials*, which are already
*made* to our hands. Even *Nature* her self, as hath been said,
*Maketh* nothing *new*;
 *Ch. 3. §. 1.* but only *mixeth* all things. So far, therefore,
as we can govern *Mixture*, we may do what *Nature* doth.

20. §. Which that we may still the better understand; let us before,
and in the next place, see the *Causes* of *Mixture*.
 *Ch. 3. §. 18.* For since
*Natural* and *Artificial Mixture* are the *same*; the *immediate Causes* of
both, are and must be the *same*.
