### CHAP. V.

### Of the Figuration of Trunks.

HE
*Fifth Head*, shall be, of the *Figuration* of
*Trunks*. Which also, as well as the *making* of
*Liquors*, dependeth upon the *Structure* of the
*Parts*. As *First*, almost all *Shrubs* (*cæteris paribus*)
have a greater number of *Aer-Vessels*; and
those of a smaller Size; and consequently much
spread abroad, as most easily yielding to the
*magnetick* Power of the *Aer*, according as we
have more fully demonstrated, in speaking of
the *Vegetation* of *Roots*: as in *Elder*, *Hazel*, *Fig*, *Sumach*, and the like.
By which spreading, the said *Aer-Vessels* do sooner, and more easily
strike into the *Barque*, and so produce collateral *Buds* and *Branches*, and
that upon the first rising of the *Body* from the *Root*: that is, the *Plant*
becomes a *Shrub*.

2. §. BUT if the said *Aer-Vessels* are very large, they will not
yield so easily to shoot out collaterally; and so the *Trunk* grows up
taller and more entire: as in *Oak*, *Wallnut*, *Elm*, &c. wherein they are
exceeding large, is seen. Hence also the *Vine*, if supported, will grow to a
prodigious length. And *Hops* and *Bryony*, are some of the tallest, amongst
all *Annual Growths*: the *Aer-Vessels* of all which, are very large. Whereas
*Borage*, and many other like *Plants*, although the *Pores* of their *Parenchyma*,
are vastly wide, and filled with *Sap*; yet because their *Aer-Vessels*
are small, they are therefore but *Dwarf-Plants*. Wherefore the tallness
or advancement of a *Plant* or *Tree*, dependeth not upon the *Plenty*
of *Sap*, how great soever, but on the *Largeness* of the *Aer-Vessels*.

3. §. AGAIN, as a *Plant* or *Tree* grows either *Shrubby*, or *Tall*
and *Entire*, according to the *Size* of the said *Vessels*: so from their
*Position*, doth it grow *Slender* or *Thick*. So, where they keep more
within the compass of a *Ring*, as in *Elm*, and *Ash*, the *Tree*, in proportion,
usually grows taller, and less thick. But where the said
*Vessels* are spread more abroad, and especially are postured in *Rays*, as
they are in *Oak*, the *Tree* grows very thick. Because the said *Vessels* thus
standing all along nearer to the *Insertions*, there is a more ready and
copious passage of the *Aer* out of the one into the other; and so the
*Diametral* growth of the *Wood* is more promoted.

4. §. LASTLY, from the same general cause it is, That the *Trunks* of
*Vegetables* are either *Round* or *Angular*. Those of all *Trees* are
*Round*. Because the *Barque*, being here thicker, and the *Aer-Vessels*
bound up with a greater quantity of *Wood*; the *Aer* hath not sufficient
power to move them, and the *Barque* with them, into those various
*Positions* or *Figurations*, as the *Trunks* of *Herbs* do yield to.

5. §. Yet the cause of the various *shapes* of the *Trunk*, is not the
*Aer* alone; but partly, the *Principles* of the *Plants* themselves, in conjunction
therewith; according to the predominion whereof, and chiefly
of some certain kind of *Salt* or *Salts*, as I shall hereafter⁠[63] more
particularly explicate, the *Trunk* is *Square*, *Triangular*, *Pentangular*,
or otherwise *Figured*. And thus much in general of the *Figuration*
of *Trunks*.
