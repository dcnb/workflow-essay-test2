### CHAP. I.

### The Descriptions of several Trunks, as they appear to the
    bare Eye.

![T](images/i_drop_t_148.jpg)
*O
 the* end we may clearly understand, what the
*Trunk*, *Stalk*, or *Branch* of a *Plant*, is; I shall
by these *Figures* here before us, Describe the
several *Parts*, whereof it is compounded.

1. §. And for examples sake, I shall in the
first place, Describe the *Trunks* of some *Plants*,
as being cut tranversly, and accurately observ’d,
they appear to the naked Eye. And some
others, as by the length. Which having done,
I shall next proceed to a more particular Description of divers other
*Trunks* and *Branches* as they appear through a good *Microscope*. In
both shewing, not only what their several *Parts* are, as generally belonging
to a *Branch*; but also, by a Comparative Prospect, in what
respects they are *specifically* distinguished one from another, in the several
*Sorts* of *Branches*.

2. §. I SHALL begin where the Work of *Nature* appears less
Diversify’d: as in the *Stalk* of *Maze* or *Indian Wheat*. In which, although
there are the same *Parenchymous* and *Lignous Parts*, as in all
other *Plants*; *Tab. 18.* yet is there neither *Barque*, nor *Pith*; the *Vessels* being
dispersed and mixed with the *Parenchyma*, from the Circumference to
the Centre of the *Stalk*: Saving, that in and next the *Skin*, there
seems to be no *Aer-Vessels*. Every where else, they run up, like fine
*Threds*, through the length of the *Stalk*: Each *Thred* being also surrounded
with *Sap-Vessels*; which in a Slice cut transversly, appear in
very small and dark colour’d *Rings*. The like structure may also be
seen in the *Sugar-Cane*, and some other *Plants*.

3. §. LET the next *Trunk* be that of *Taraxacum*, or *Dandelion*. In
a *slice* whereof, being cut transversly, is seen next the *Skin*, first, a
simple, white, and close *Parenchyma* or *Barque*; *Tab. 18.* made up of *Vesicles*;
but such as are exceeding small; and hardly visible without a *Glass*.

4. §. Within This, stand *Milk-Vessels* in seven or eight distinct *Colums*,
of different size: each *Colum* being also made up of seven or
eight *Arched Lines*. Betwixt these *Colums*, run as many *Diametral
Portions*, derived from the *Barque*, into or towards the *Pith*.

5. §. Next within These, stand the *Aer-Vessels*. Which are likewise
divided, by the said *Diametral Portions*, into divers *Arched
Lines*. The *size* of these *Vessels*, as well as their *number*, is small.

6. §. Within These, stands the *Pith*, consisting of very small *Vesicles*
or *Bladders*, as the *Barque*. ’Tis very small, the *Diameter* hereof,
being scarce one *fifth*, of that of the *Pith* of *Borage*. But the
*Barque* of *Borage* is not half so thick as this of *Dandelion*.

7. §. FOR a Third *Stalk*, we may take that of *Borage*; wherein
there is some further Variety. For in a *slice* hereof, cut transversly,
there appears, first a Tough, yet Thin and Transparent *Skin*. Within
this *Skin*, and *Continuous* therewith, there is also a Thin *Ring* of *Sap-Vessels*:
*Tab. 18.* which, without being crushed in the least, do yield a *Lympha*.

8. §. Next standeth the *Parenchyma* of the *Barque*. Which is
made up of a great number of very small *Vesicles* or *Bladders*. Upon
the inner *Verge* of this *Parenchyma*, standeth another *Ring* of *Sap-Vessels*:
which also yield a *Lympha*; and that different, as is probable, from
the *Lympha* in the utmost *Ring*. Hitherto goes the *Barque*.

9. §. Adjacent to the *Ring* of *Sap-Vessels*, on the inner *Verge* of
*Barque*, stand the *Aer-Vessels* on the outer *Verge* of the *Pith*. Not in a
*Ring*; but in several *Parcels*; some *Parcels* or *Conjugations*, in the figure
of little *Specks*; others, in little *Arched Lines*, almost like an V *Consonant*.
And being viewed in a good *Glass*, there appears to be within
the compass of every larger *Speck or Parcel*, about 20 or 30 *Aer-Vessels*
and within the smallest, about 8 or 10.

10. §. The *Pith*, in a well grown *Stalk* of this *Plant*; is always
*hollow*. But originally, it is *entire*. It is likewise wholly made up
of a great number of *Vesicles*: of which, through a *Glass*, some appear
*Pentangular*, others *Sexangular*, and *Septangular*. Most of them are
larger than those of the *Barque*; so as to be plainly visible to a naked
Eye.

11. §. A FOURTH *Trunk*, shall be that of *Colewort*, which
seems likewise, to have at least, two Sorts of *Lymphæducts*. For being
cut transversly, as the former, we may observe, next the *Skin*, a

very close *Parenchyma*, of a darkish Green. Wherewith are mixed
some few *Sap Vessels*, which give it that *Colour*.

12. §. Within This, stands a *scalloped Parenchymous Ring*, or a
*Ring* of many short and slender white *Arches*. *Tab. 18.* Which all round about
the *Barque*, meeting together, run in so many white *Diametral Portions*,
or extream small *Rays*, into the *Pith*.

13. §. Betwixt these white *Rays*, and next of all to the said white
*Arches*, stand as many small *Parcels* of *Sap-Vessels*, like so many little
*Half-Ovals*. Within each of which, is included a white *Parenchyma*.

14. §. On the inner *Verge* of the *Barque*, stands another Sort of
*Sap-Vessels*, in one slender and entire *Ring*. And so far goes the
*Barque*.

15. §. Next within this *Ring* stand the *Aer-Vessels*, in several *Parcels*,
diametrically opposite to the said white *Parenchymous Parcels* next
without the *Sap-Ring*.

16. §. Last of all, and more within the *Pith*, stand the same kind
of *Sap-Vessels*, as those of the *Half-Ovals*. Both these, by small lines,
run one into another; thus, on both sides, hemming in the *Aer-Vessels*,
and so making altogether, so many little *Pyramids*.

17. §. LET a *Fifth* be that of *Holyoak*. In which, the Curiosity
of *Nature*, is still more copious: presenting us, as it  seems, with
Three sorts of *Lymphæducts*; Of which, two yield a *Thin*; the Third,
a *Thick Lympha*. For being cut, as before, next to the *Skin*, stands the
*Barque*; somewhat close, and, in proportion, *Thick*.

18. §. Towards the inner *Verge* hereof, stand one sort of *Sap-Vessels*,
postur’d in short *Rays*. These *Vessels* yield a *Mucilage*. And on the
inner *Verge* of the *Barque*, stands a Thin *Ring* of other *Sap-Vessels*,
which yield a *thinner Liquor*. *Tab. 18.*

19. §. Next within the *Barque* stand the *Aer-Vessels*, postur’d likewise
in short *Rays*, diametrically opposite to those in the *Barque*. In
every *Ray*, there are about twelve or sixteen *Vessels*.

20. §. Lastly, and more within the *Pith*, there stand other *Sap-Vessels*,
all in very Thin or Slender *Arched-Lines*; thus hemming in the
several *Parcels* of *Aer-Vessels*.

21. §. FOR a *Sixth*, I will take that of Wild *Cucumer*: Wherein
is also found a *Mucilaginous Lympha*. For first of all, next to the
*Skin*, there is a *Ring* of *Sap-Vessels.* Which *Ring* is also radiated, the
*Rays*, all poynting towards, and most of them terminating on, the
*Skin*. *Tab. 18.*

22. §. Next of all, there is a thick, and simple *Parenchymous Ring*.
On the inner *Verge* whereof, there are other *Sap-Vessels* standing in
*Parcels*, also in a *Ring*. So far goes the *Barque*.

23. §. Next within, stand the *Aer-Vessels*, in as many *Parcels*, contiguous
to those of the *Sap-Vessels* aforesaid. To which likewise are
adjoyned as many more *Parcels* of *Sap-Vessels* within the *Pith*, opposite
to the said *Sap-Vessels* within the *Barque*.

24. §. FOR a *Seventh*, we may choose that of *Scorzonera*. In
which, the *Vessels* are both *Lymphæducts*, and *Lactiferous*. All of them,
with the *Aer-Vessels*, in a radiated posture. For first next the outer
Edg of the *Barque*, stand the *Lactiferous*, in little *Specks*. *Tab. 18.* Next to
these, on the inner Edg of the *Barque*, stand the *Lymphæducts*, in the
same form.

25. §. Hereunto adjacent, on the outer Edg of the *Pith*, stand the
*Aer-Vessels*, some in *Specks*, and some in extream short *Lines*; hardly
distinguished, without a very nice Inspection.

26. §. Within These, are placed other *Lymphæducts*, opposite to
those in the *Barque*. And within these *Lymphæducts*, still in the same
radiated Line, run more of the *Milk-Vessels*.

27. §. AN EIGHTH, may be that of *Burdock*; Wherein first,
there are a Sort of *Lymphæducts*, which stand in *Arched Parcels*, round
the *Trunk*, adjacent to the *Skin*. *Tab. 18.*

28. §. Within these, about the middle of the *Barque*, run the
*Milk-Vessels*, in the form of small round *Specks*.

29. §. Next to these on the inner Edg of the *Barque* are placed
other *Lymphæducts*. Which, together with more of the same in the
*Pith*, and the *Aer-Vessels* betwixt them, stand all in Radiated Lines, of
several Lengths, and all sharpning towards the Centre.

30. §. LET the *Ninth*, be that of *Endive*: In which there is also
much curious Work. *Tab. 18.* Next to the *Skin*, there is, first, a thick and
simple *Parenchyma*. Then there is a kind of *Undulated Ring* of *Milk-Vessels*.
Within which stand a Sort of *Lymphæducts*, in several *Parcels*;
some, in *Arched Half-Ovals*; others, in short slender *Rays*. Betwixt
these *Parcels*, many of the *Milk-Vessels* likewise stand.

31. §. Next there is an *undulated Ring* of other *Lymphæducts*, parting
as in most *Trunks*, betwixt the *Barque* and the *Pith*. Within which,
are the *Aer-Vessels*. And within These, more *Sap-Vessels*. Both of them,
in small *Specks*, answerable, or opposite to the *Rays* in the *Barque*.

*Tab. 18.* 32. §. I SHALL give also one or two Examples of *Trees*, or *Arborescent
Plants*; the *Vine* and *Common Sumach*. In a Slice of the former
cut transversly, next the *Skin*, there is a Thin *Barque*. In the inner
part whereof, adjacent to the *Wood*, stand the *Lymphæducts* in several
*Half-Oval Parcels*, opposite to so many Radiated Pieces of the
*Wood*.

33. §. The *Wood* is divided into the said Pieces, by as many *Parenchymous
Rays*, inserted from the *Barque*, and so continuous therewith.

34. §. Within these Radiated Pieces of *Wood*, stand the *Aer-Vessels*;
the largest of which, especially if held up against the light, are
plainly visible to the bare Eye.

35. §. Within the hollow of the *Wood*, stands the *Pith*; in the
young Growths always large. In the utmost *Verge* whereof, adjacent
to the *Wood*, stand a few more *Sap-Vessels* of the same Sort with those
in the *Barque*.

*Tab. 18.* 36. §. IN A like Slice of *Common Sumach*, contiguous to the hairy
*Skin*, there is a *Ring* of *Lymphæducts*. Next to this a Simple *Parenchyma*.
Then several *Arched Parcels* of *Lymphæducts*. Within these, a
*Ring* of *Milk-Vessels*. And then a *Ring* of other *Lymphæducts*. Thus
far the *Barque*.

37. §. Within the *Barque*, stands the *Wood*, divided into several
*Portions*, by the Diametral *Insertions* divided from the *Barque*. In
the Body of the *Wood*, stand the *Aer-Vessels*, very much smaller than in
the *Vine*.

38. §. The hollow of the *Wood* is filled up with the *Pith*. In
the Circumference of which, stands a *Ring* of *Lymphæducts*, of the
same sort with those next to the *Wood* without.

39. §. All the *Parts* of these *Trunks*, may, as I have now described
them, be observed without a *Microscope*: excepting the *Bladders*
and number of *Aer-Vessels*. Yet Three things are hereunto necessary;
*viz.* a good *Eye*, a clear *Light*, and a *Rasor*, or very keen *Knife*,
wherewith to cut them with a smooth surface, and so as not to Dislocate
the *Parts*.

40. §. UPON *Inspection* also by the length, there are some particulars,
common, more or less, to most *Plants*, yet better observable in
some, than in others. As first, the *Reticulation* of the *Vessels*, (formerly
described) not only in the *Wood*, but in the *Barque*: *Tab. 19.* which is evident
in a young *Branch* of *Corin*, upon the very Surface thereof, when some
of the *Vessels* begin to be cast off into the *Skin*. And so, by stripping
off the *Skin*, upon the Surface of the *Wood*.

41. §. In cutting by the length, as well as transversly, the young
*Fibres*, which grow within the *Wood* in the Edg of the *Pith*, are also
seen. As likewise the manner of the Derivation of the *Parts* of the *Bud*
from the *Branch* or *Stalk*; as in *Sonchus*. There are also many Varieties
in the *Pith*, such as those hereafter mentioned⁠[57] which fall under
observation only in cutting by the length.
