### Of the ORIGINAL, FIGURES, MOTIONS,
    and AGES of ROOTS.

EING
TO speak of *Roots*; it is requisite, for
our better understanding of what follows, that some
things, as to their *Original*, *Figures*, *Motions* and
*Ages*, be premised.

1. §. *Roots*, taken altogether, have a Three-fold
Original. Either from the *Radicle*; as all
*Roots* which come of the *Seed*: or from the *Trunk*
or *Caulis*, above ground; as in *Strawberry*, *Chamæmile*, and many other
*Creepers*: or from the *Trunk* or *Caulis*, after it is sunk under ground;
as in *Primrose*, *Bistort*, and many others; and presently shall be shewed
how.

2. §. In the Growth of a *Bud*, and of a *Trunk-Root*, there is
this observable difference; That the former, carries along with it, some
portion of every *Part* in the *Trunk* or *Stalk*; whereof it is a *Compendium*.
The latter, always shoots forth, by making a Rupture in the
*Barque*, which it leaves behind, and proceeds only from the inner part
of the *Stalk*.

3. §. As also, That in a *Bud*, the *Lignous Part* is spread abroad,
so as to encompass a *Pith*. Whereas in a *Trunk-Root*, it makes a solid
Thred standing in the Center. Which is the Cause of its descending
into the Ground: as is already, in the *First* **Book**, and shall in
This be further shewed.

4. §. ROOTS are generally distinguished, as to their *Figures*,
in being more Entire, as is that of *Liquirish*; or Parted, as of St. *Johns-wort*.
Parted or Forked, either at the Bottom, as most *Roots*; or at
the Top, as *Dandelyon*, and some others. A thing very odd, and unintelligible,
without the knowledge of the *Motions* of *Roots*; whereof
presently.

5. §. Parted, again, are either Ramified, as that of *Cumfry*; or
Manifold, as of *Crowfoot*: both are Parted; but the former, by the
subdivision of greater *Branches*, into lesser; these, when divers *Strings*,
have all their distinct original from one *Head*. Some are Straight, as a
*Radish*; others Crooked, as *Bistort*. Smooth, as *Bugloss*; or Stringy
all round about, as *Columbine*. And to *Carnations*, this seems to be
peculiar, That sometimes many of the *Strings* run parallell with the
*Wood* of the great *Root*, through the *Barque*, or betwixt the *Wood* and
the *Barque*.

6. §. Again, some are Thick, as *Rhubarb*; Slender, as the *Vine*.
Long, as *Fenil*; Short, as a *Turnep*: which are distinct from Great and
Little; in that these, are so called with respect to several *Roots*; those,
with respect to the several Dimensions of one. Short, are Stubbed, as
*Iris tuberosa*; or Round, as *Dracontium*. Round are Tuberous, or Simply
Knobbed, as *Rape-Crowfoot*; Bulbous, that is Scaled, as some Lilys; or
Shell’d, as an *Onion*. Where note, That all Bulbous *Roots*, are, as it
were, Hermaphrodites, or *Root* and *Trunk* both together: for the
*Strings* only, are absolute *Roots*; the *Bulb*, actually containing those
*Parts*, which springing up, make the *Leaves* or *Body*; and is, as it were,
a Great *Bud* under ground.

7. §. *Roots*, again, are Even or Uneven; Even, are Cylindrical,
as *Eryngo*; or Pyramidal, as *Borage*. Growing smaller Downwards,
as do most; or Upwards, as *Skirrets*. Uneven, are Pitted, as *Potato’s*,
where the *Eyes* or *Buds* of the future *Trunks* lie inward; or Knotted,
as *Jerusalem-Artichoke*; where they stand out. These Differences, are
also Compounded: so some *Roots* are both Entire and Smooth, as
*Peony*; others Entire, but Stringy, as *Clary*: that is, neither Ramifi’d,
nor yet Brushy, or divided at the Top into severall small *Strings*; but a
Single *Root* surrounded with many Hairy *Threds*. Some both Plain in
some parts, and Knobbed in others, as *Filipendula*, *Lilium non bulbosum*,
and others.

8. §. Some also have two or more *Roots*; and those of one Kind:
of which, some are distinctly fastend to the bottome of the *Stalk*, as in
*Dogstones*; some stand one under another, so as only the uppermost is
fasten’d to the *Stalk*, as in *Dragon*, *Crocus*, and others. And there are
some, which have not only two *Roots*, at the same time; but those also
of two distinct Kinds, as in *Bistort*; one of them, a slender strait
Cylindrick and horizontall *Root*; the other large and crooked, and
bred of the Descending *Trunk*; as in speaking next of the *Motions* of
*Roots*, will be understood, how. All which, with other Differences

by Those that undertake the *Descriptions* of *Plants*, are accurately to
be Noted. But the Differences, above mentioned, will serve for our
present Purpose.

9. §. THE MOTIONS of *Roots* are also divers. Sometimes
Level, as are those of *Hops*, *Ammi*, *Cinquefoyle*; and all such as properly
*Creep*. Sometimes Perpendicular, as that of *Parsnep*: Which is
different from Straightness; for some Straight *Roots*, are Level. Both
of them are either Shallow or Deep: some run Level, and near the
*Turf*, as *Woodbind*, *Wild Anenomy*; others lower, as *Dogs-Grass*. Some
strike down, but a little way, as *Stramonium*; others grow deep, as
*Horse-Radish*: Which is different from being Long; for many long
*Roots*, are Level, as *Hops*.

10. §. Some again Descend, as *Tulips*, and other Bulbous *Roots*,
which differs from growing only Downwards; in that here, the
*Head* of the *Root* is Immoveable; but in Descending, the whole *Root*
obteineth different Places, running deeper, time after time, into the
*Earth*. Some also Ascend, sometimes, and in some part, appearing
above ground, as *Turneps*.

11. §. These *Motions* are also Compounded; both in respect of
the several Parts of the *Root*, and of several Times. So the main
*Root* of *Primrose*, is Level; the Strings are Perpendicular. The
*Roots* of most *Seedlings* grow Downward and Upward, or shoot out
in length at both Ends, at the same time. Those of *Bistort*, *Iris*,
and some others, grow, in part, both Downward and Upward at several
times: Whence it is, that *Bistort* is Crooked, with some resemblance
to an S, according to its *Name*; And that some Parts of *Iris-Root*
appear oftentimes above the ground.

12. §. There is also another *Motion*, in some *Roots*, not heeded;
and that is *Contortion*: whereby, without being moved out of their
Place, they are Writhed or Twisted; as a piece of Cloath is, when
the Water is wrung out of it; as in *Carduus*, *Sonchus*, and others:
whether always I cannot say. This *Motion* cannot be noted, without
stripping off the *Barque*; whereby the *Vessels* may be seen, sometimes,
to make two or three Circumvolutions. This *Motion* seems to
be governed by the winding of the *Stalk*; and therefore to begin at
the Head, and terminate at the Poynt or lower end of the *Root*, which
is immoveable.

13. §. BUT ABOVE all the *Motions* of *Roots*, not observed,
the most remarkable is that of DESCENT. Which, although it hath
been noted, by some *Botanicks*, of *Bulbous Roots*; yet of these only:
Whereas it is the Property, of a great many more; and those, of very
different Kinds; probably, of the far greater number of *Perennial Roots*
of *Herbs*; as of *Arum*, *Rape-Crowfoot*, *Valerian*, *Brownwort*, *Bears-foot*,
*Tansy*, *Lychnis*, *Sampier*, *Primrose*, *Ammi*, *Avens*, *Wood-sorrel*,
*Iris*, and others. Of all which *Plants*, it is very observable, That
their *Root*, is annually *renewed*, or *repaired*, out of the *Trunk* or *Stalk*
it self. That is to say, The *Basis* of the *Stalk* continually, and by
insensible Degrees, descending below the surface of the *Earth*, and
hiding it self therein; is thus, both in Nature, Place, and Office changed
into a true *Root*. Which *Root*, by the continuance of the said

*Motion* of the *Stalk*, also *Descends*; and so, according to the durableness
of its Substance, becomes a shorter or longer *Root*; the Elder
or Lower Portion thereof, Rotting off, by the same Degrees with
the Generation of the Upper, out of the *Stalk*. So in *Brownwort*, the
*Basis* of the *Stalk* sinking down by degrees, till it lies under Ground,
becomes the upper part of the *Root*; and continuing still to sink,
the next year, becomes the lower Part; and the next after that, rots
away; a new Addition being still yearly made out of the *Stalk*, as
the elder Parts yearly rot away. *Tab. 5. f. 6, & 7.* So in *Dragon*, *Crocus*, and the like,
where the *Root* is double; the *Basis* of the *Stalk*, this year; the next,
becomes the Upper-*Root*; after that, the Lower-*Root*; and at the
length dies and is consum’d.

14. §. The Demonstration hereof, is taken, more evidently, from
some *Roots*, than from others; as from the Level and Knobed *Roots*
of *Wood-sorrel*, *Primrose*, &c. *Tab. 5. f. 1, & 2.* For the *Leaves* of those *Plants* rotting off
successively, and the *Bases* of those *Leaves* gradually descending into the
Ground; each *Basis* is thus nourished with a more copious *Sap*, and so
swelled into so many thick *Knots*. It may likewise be gather’d in
some, from the like Position of the *Vessels* or Woody Parts, in the *Root*,
as in the *Trunk*; as in *Bares-foot*, As also, from the *Root* of the *Iris
Tuberosa*: *Tab. 5. f. 4.* where, although the *Leaves* fall off close to the Surface of
the *Stalk*; yet after that is sunk down, and swell’d into a *Root*, the
*Seats* of the perished *Leaves*, and the Ends of the *Vessels* belonging to
them, are not obscurely visible; whereby the *Root* is wrought, as it
were, with several *Seames* and *Prickt Lines*; the *Seams* shewing the
setting on of the *Leaves*; and the *Pricks*, the Terminations or broken
Ends of the *Vessels*: which ends, are still more apparent, upon the
stripping off the *Barque*. I considered likewise, That as among *Animals*,
there are many, which are not Bred of *Eggs*, immediately; but
are Transformed, one *Animal* into another: So, it is more than probable,
That among *Plants*, there are not a few Instances of the like
*Transformations*; whereof, this is one.

15. §. The *Cause* of this *Descent*, so far as it is dependent on the
Inward Conformation of the *Root*, I shall shew in the following
**Part**. But the Immediate Visible one, are the *String-Roots*, which
this kind of *Trunks* frequently put forth: which, descending themselves
directly into the Ground, like so many *Ropes*, lug the *Trunk* after
them. Hence the *Tuberous-Roots* of *Iris* upon the rotting or fading
away of the *String-Roots* hanging at them, sometimes a little Re-ascend.
Hence also the *Shape* of some *Roots* is Inverted: For whereas most are
parted downwards, into several *Legs*; some are parted upwards into
divers *Necks*, as *Dandelyon*, and others. *Tab. 5. f. 5.* For these *Roots* sending forth
at the top several *Trunk-Buds*, the said *Buds* successively put forth new,
and cast their old *Leaves*; and continually also making their Descent,
are at length formed into so many *Necks*, of three, four, five, or more
Inches long, under Ground.

16. §. HENCE ALSO we understand, in what particular way,
some *Roots* become *Perennial*. Some are wholly so, as those of *Trees*,
*Shrubs*, and divers other woody *Plants*. Others, in part, or by a
new *Progenies* of *Roots*, from the old Head or Body, in the room of
those that die yearly, or after a certain Time; as of *Lilium non bulbosum*,

*Jerusalem Artichoke*, *Potato*, *Dog-stones*, *Monks-hood*, *little Celandine*,
and others. In which *Plants*, one or more of their *Roots* are
firm, the other spongy and superannuated; and partly, by the ravine
of the *Trunk*, and other younger *Roots*, reduced to a Consumption and
Death.

17. §. With these, *Tulips*, and other *Bulbous-Roots* consort: For the several
*Rindes* & *Shells*, whereof chiefly, the *Bulb* consists, successively perish
and shrink up into so many thin and dry *Skins*: betwixt which, and in
their Centre, other *Leaves* and *Shells*, being successively formed, the
*Bulb* is thus perpetuated. In the same manner the *String-Roots* also succeed
one another annually. So that at the end of divers Years, although
it be still looked upon as the same *Individual Root*, yet it is, in truth,
Another, as to every particle thereof.

18. §. Lastly, many other *Roots* are perpetuated by the aforesaid
Descent of the *Trunk*; out of which, it is still annually Repaired, as
by the gradual perishing of its lower parts, it is Diminished; as hath
been said. Whence also we see the reason of the Rugged and Blunt
extremities of these, *Tab. 5. f. 3.* and some other *Roots*, as of that *Plant* superstitiously
called *Devils-bit*: because the end of it seems to be bitten off.
Yet doth it not appear so originally; but the Lower part thereof rotting
off, as the Upper descends; the living remainder, becometh
stumped, or seemeth Bitten. Thus far of the *Original*, *Shapes*, *Motions*,
and *Ages* of *Roots*.
