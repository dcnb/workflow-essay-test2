### CHAP. II.

### Of the PEAR and QUINCE.

![A](images/i_drop_a_182.jpg)

PEAR, besides the *Skin*, consisteth of a Twofold
*Parenchyma*, of *Vessels*, *Tartareous Knots* or *Grains*,
and a *Coar*. The *Skin* is lined with a great number
of the said *Tartareous Grains*, through a *Glass*,
about the bigness of small *Shot*: whereby it looks
withinside, like the *Skin* of the *Scate* and some other
*Fishes*. *Tab. 67.* Besides those which grow to the *Skin*, there
are also many more standing near adjacent to it all round about the
*Fruit*: altogether about ⅓ᵈ of an Inch in thickness, through a *Microscope*;
as in a Slice of a *Pear* cut transversly is apparent. Somewhat
more or less, as I take it, according to the Delicacy or Harshness of the
*Fruit*; as more in a *Burgamy*, or other soft and sweet *Pear*, than in those
which are called *Strangulatoria*. As all *Vinous Liquors*, and those especially
which are the most *Tartareous*, become more soft and sweet, according
as they cast off their *Tartar*, in a greater quantity, upon the
Sides of the *Vessel*.

2. §. The Outer *Parenchyma*, is of the same Original, and general
Structure, as in an *Apple*. But the *Bladders*, answerable to the Shape
of this *Fruit*, not altogether so long, with respect to their Bredth.
*Tab. 67.* Throughout this *Parenchyma*, are also dispersed many small *Tartareous
Grains*; most of them somewhat round, as those next the *Skin*, and
of a like *Size*; but nothing near so numerous.

3. §. The *Bladders* here, have also a different *Position* from that
they have in an *Apple*: there, they are all stretched out, as to have
respect to one common Centre, which is that of the *Apple* it self. But
here, they every where bear a respect to the said *Tartareous Grains*, *Tab. 67.* every
*Grain* being the Centre of a certain Number of *Bladders*; like a *Star*,
in the midle of its *Vortex*. Whereby, so many of the *Tartareous parts*
of the *Sap*, as cannot well be thrown off upon the *Skin*, are more
commodiously discharged, upon every little *Knot* or *Grain*, nearer
hand.

4. §. Throughout this *Parenchyma*, the *Vessels* likewise are dispersed.
Of the Two general Kinds, for *Sap*, and for *Aer*. The *Aer-Vessels*,
are here extream small, as well as in an *Apple*; yet one degree,
larger. They are both together distributed into Fifteen principal
*Branches*. *Tab. 67.* The Five Utmost make as many *Arckes*, but commonly not
near so deep as in an *Apple*. From these, some small *Fibres*, yet a little
more numerously than in an *Apple*, are dispersed throughout the
*Parenchyma*. The Ten Inmost run along to the *Seed*, and from thence,
with the other Five, to the *Flower*.

5. §. Next the *Coar*, stands the Inner *Parenchyma*, in divers respects
different from the Outer. The *Bladders* of the latter, as hath been
said, large and long; of the former, small and round, answerable to
those of the *Pith*, of which it seems to be derived. Throughout that,

the *Vessels* and *Tartareous Grains* are dispersed; in this, there are neither.
The *Effect* whereof is, that is sweet, this sower; *Tab. 67.* for which
reason, I have taken leave to name it, the *Acetary*.

6. §. Betwixt this and the outer *Parenchyma*, the said *Tartareous
Grains* begin, first to stand nearer together, to grow biger, and of a
more unequal Surface; and by degrees, to unite into a *Body*, in some
*Pears*, *Tab. 67.*
 and especially towards the *Cork*, almost as hard as a *Plum-Stone*;
which I have thereupon, named the *Calculary*.
 *B. 1. Ch. 6.* So that a *Pear*, is Natures
*Preface* or *Introduction* to a *Plum*.

7. §. This *Tartareous Body*, and those small *Grains* above said, I
have formerly supposed, *B. 1. Ch. 6.*
 to be precipitated out of the *Sap*, by virtue of
the *Vessels*. Which is not only argued from their growing, where
the *Vessels*, only in the outer *Parenchyma*: but in that the very *Bounds*
or *Figure* of the *Calculary*, is determined by the *Situation* of the chief of
those *Vessels*; *Tab. 67.* as in cuting a *Pear* smoothly through the Centre and by
the Length, is apparent.

8. §. The *Coar* as well as the *Acetary*, seems to be derived from the
*Pith*. And is therefore lesser here, than in an *Apple*, where the whole
*Pith* of the *Stalk*, goes to the making of the *Coar* only.

9. §. In most *Pears*, at the bottom of the *Coar*, and a little below
the Centre of the *Fruit*, there is a kind of small *Umbelical Knot*; *Tab. 67.* from
whence is extended a straight *Chanel* or *Ductus*, which opens at the
midle of the *Cork* or *Stool* of the *Flower*, scarce wide enough to admit
the smallest *Pin*. Made for the *Use* hereafter mentioned.

10. §. A QUINCE, is nearly allyed to a *Pear*. The differences
betwixt them are these; In the *Quince*, the outer *Parenchyma*
is more close, that is, the *Bladders* are smaller. *Tab. 67.* The *Vessels* more numerous,
and more deeply enarched; the *Calculary* greater, and more
spread; according to the *Shape* of the *Fruit*: but the *Acetary*, less:
The *Coar* stands higher or nearer to the *Cork*; divided, not into Five,
but Four *Cells*. And the *Ductus* from the bottom of the *Coar* to the
top of the *Fruit*, much more open and observable.
