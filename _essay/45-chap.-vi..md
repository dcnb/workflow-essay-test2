### CHAP. VI.

### Of the Time of the Generation of the Flower.

![T](images/i_drop_t_119.jpg)
HE
*Time* in which the *Flower* is Generated or Formed
is a Providence in Nature, whereof, I do a little
wonder, that no one, amongst so many observers
of *Plants*, hath ever yet taken any notice. It is
therefore to be remarked, That all *Flowers* are formed
or perfectly finished, in all their *Parts*, long
before they appear in sight; usually Three or Four
Months, and sometimes half a year, or more. And that in all *Perennial
Plants*, those *Flowers* which appear and are called the *Flowers* of
any one year; are not formed in that year; but were actually in
*Being*, and entirely formed in all *Parts*, the year before; as in many
*Herbs*, and in all *Shrubs* and *Trees*.

2. §. This will best be seen by some Instances. So the *Flower* of
*Mezereon*, which opens in *January*, is entirely formed about the midle
of *August* in the year foregoing. At which time, the *Green Leaves* of
the *Bud* being cautiously removed, *Tab. 63.* the *Leaves* of the *Flower*, and the
*Thecæ Seminiformes* or *Seed-like Attire*, encompassing the *Seed-Case*,
through an indifferent *Glass*, are all distinctly visible.

3. §. The like may be seen in *Sirynga*, and other *Shrubs*, and in
*Trees*. In as many of which, as are *Frugiferous*, the *Fruit* also, which
answers to the *Seed-Case* in other *Plants*, is about the same time entirely
formed.

4. §. And so in *Herbs*; as the *Flower* of *Asarum*, which appeareth
in *April* or *May*, is entirely formed in *August* or *July* of the foregoing
year. For there are here, as well as in *Trees*, *Tab. 64.* Two Sorts of *Buds*; some
which are composed only of *Green Leaves*; and some which also contein
a *Flower* and the *Seed-Case*. So in *Bears-foot*, by some called the
*January Rose*, the *Flower-Buds*, which open in *January* are all formed
in or before the Month of *August* in the year preceding.

5. §. The same may also be seen about the end of *August* or the beginning
of *September* in a *Tulip-Root*. *Tab. 63.* In which, the Two Inmost *Shells*
dryer than the rest, stand hollow, with the little young *Flower* (which
appears in *March* or *April* following) inclosed now in their *Centre*. Being
thus kept *warm* and *dry*, lest it should either perish, or be precipitated
upon the *Winter*, by sprouting too soon.

6. §. From hence it is plain, That although the *Flower* appears before
the *Seed*; yet if the comparison be made betwixt the *Flower* and
*Seed* of the same year; the *Seed* is first formed, and afterward the
*Flower*. That is, the *Seed*, for which Nature chooses the Firstborn
*Sap*, is formed in the fore part of the year: which work being
finished, out of the less *fœcund part* of the *Sap*, the *Flowers* intended
for the *Sire* and *Matrix* of the next years *Seed*; is afterwards produced.

7. §. THE true *Time* of the *Generation* of the *Flower* being
know’n, it may also be an Inducement to make Tryal, for the bringing
of many *Flowers* to grow fairly in *Winter*, which are used to grow, that
is, to appear, only in the *Spring* and *Summer*: *sc.* by keeping the *Plants*
warm, and thereby enticing the young lurking *Flowers* to come abroad.

### The Appendix.

### Being a Method proposed, for the ready finding, by the
    Leaf and Flower, to what Sort any Plant belongeth.

![A](images/i_drop_a_182.jpg)
LTHOUGH
many have bestowed extraordinary
Care and Industry upon the searching out, and
Description of *Plants*; and for the reducing of
them to their several *Tribes*: yet I will take leave,
here to propose a short *Method* whereby Learners,
seeing a *Plant* they know not, may be informed
to what Sort it belongs, and so be directed
where to find it described and discoursed of. For, except they have
a Master to conduct them, which few have; they must needs, by seeking
at random, lose a great deal of time, which by a regular Enquiry might
be saved. Besides, that what is learned by their own Observation,
will abide much longer on their mind, than what they are only Poynted
to, by another.

2. §. Now the most *Philosophick* way of distinguishing or sorting
of *Plants*, were by the *Characteristick Properties* in all *Parts*, both *Compounded*,
*Constituents*, and *Contents*. But of the *Compounded*, the *Seeds*,
and some other *Parts*, are oftentimes very *minute*: and the *Roots* always
lie hid. As also the *Constituent Parts*, every where, without cuting and
the use of *Glasses*. Nor can the *Contents* be accurately observed otherwise.
So that for the *Use* here intended, those *Properties* are the fitest
to be insisted upon, which are the most *Conspicuous*, and in those *Parts*,
where the Learner may the most readily and without any difficulty
take notice of them; as in the *Flower* and *Leaf*. The *Flower* hath
Varieties enough of it self. But in regard it is often wanting, when the
*Green Leaf* is not; it is therefore convenient, that he be assisted

by both, and that the Varieties of both be distinctly reduced unto *Tables*.
Which may be done, after the following, or some other like
manner.

3. §. And First for the *Leaves*. The most obvious *Varieties* of
which, are in their *Position*, *Size* or *Shape*.

4. §. *Leaves* are fastned with, or without a *Stalk*. Without,
only close to the *Branch*, as in *Southistle*; or surrounding it, as in
*Thorow-Wax*.

5. §. Both these ways, they stand either singly, that is, but one at
the same height; or more together.

6. §. More together, in Even or Odd Numbers. In Even Numbers,
commonly Two and Two, as in *Sage*, *Polium*; Sometimes Four, as
in *Cross-wort*, *Madder*, *Herb True-Love*, *Pomum Majæ*; or more, as,
I think, in *Woodrofe*, &c. In Odd Numbers, Three, as in all *Trefoyls*,
*Strawberries*; Five, in *Pentaphil*, *Castanea Equina*; Seven, in *Tormentil*.

7. §. The *Sizes* of *Leaves* are innumerable. It is therefore necessary
to reduce them to a Standard. And so, they may be reckoned,
Three; *Small*, *Mean* and *Great*: with respect to the *Length* of the
*Leaf*, the *Breadth*, or both. From one Inch and under, all *Leaves* may
be accounted *Small*; from one Inch and over, to five Inches, *Mean*;
from five and over, *Great*.

8. §. The *Shapes* of *Leaves* are also numberless. But the most obvious
distinctions which they admit of, are such as these;

9. §. *Leaves* are *Membraneous*, as the greater part; *Squameous*, as
*Abies*, or *Filamentous*. Which are *solid*, as in *Fenil*, *Meum*, *Buphthalmum*,
*Chamemile*, *Groundpine*; or *hollow*, as in *Onion*.

10. §. *Membraneous*, have all their main *Fibres* produced either from
the *Stalk*, as in *Holyoak*; or from the middle *Stem* of the *Leaf*, as in
most. From the midle *Stem*, reciprocally, as in *Scabious*, or oppositely,
that is, one over against another, as in *Rose*: and both ways, at *Acute
Angles*, as in most; or *Right*, as in *Dandelion*.

11. §. Again, they are different with respect to the *Top*, the *Bottom*,
and the *Sides*. The *Top* is *Thorny*, as in *Furz*; or *Unarmed*. *Unarmed*,
either *Produced*, that is, *Poynted*, or at least, *Roundish*, as in *Lamium*,
*Ironwort*; or else *Reduced*, as in *Woodsorrel*. And so the *Bottom*,
is either *Reduced* towards the *Top*, as in *Ground-Ivy*; or *Produced*
upon the *Stalk*, as in *Poplar*, *Bay*, &c.

12. §. The *Sides* or *Edges* of the *Leaf*, are either of one and the
same *Measure*, as commonly; or of divers, as in *Doronicum*. Both
ways they are Even, as in *Syringa*, *Mous-ear*; or Uneven. The Uneven,
are *Prickly*, as *Holly*, *Eryngium*, *Thistle*; or Unarmed. Unarmed,
are Insected, or Resected. Insected deeply, that is, Lobed, as
*Golden Liverwort*, *Clematis Peregrina*; or with shallow *Insections*, as
in most. And so, Indented, or Scallopped: the former, when the *Angle*
is made with Straight *Lines*, as in *Dandelion*; the latter, with Crooked,
as in *Thalictrum*. Resected, that is, both Lobed, and Insected, or when
upon the greater *Insections*, there are other lesser ones, as in *Wild-Clary*,
*Lovage*, *Masterwort*.

13. §. THE most Conspicuous Varieties of *Flowers*, are in their
*Position*, *Size*, *Shape*, and *Colour*.

14. §. Most are fastned with *Stalks*; but many without. Sometimes,
they are placed round about the *Branch*, that is, Coronated, as

in *Pulegium*; and sometimes, all on one side; either in *Ranks* only, as
in *Bawm*; or in *Rank* and *File*, as in *Foxglove*. In *Saxifraga Aurea*,
they grow on the *Leaf*.

15. §. Again, they either stand Singly, as in *Corn Marigold*; or
Clustur’d. And so, either all upon one *Branch*, or on several little *Ramificated
Sprigs*. On one *Branch*, prolonged like a Tail, as in *Blattaria*;
or Contracted. And so, either without *Stalks*, that is, *Capitated*,
as in *Scabious*; or with *Stalks*, that is, *Umbellated*, as *Fenil*, &c.
On several *Sprigs*, as in *Tanacetum*, *Yarrow*.

16. §. The *Sizes* of *Flowers*, as of the *Leaves*, may be reduced to
Three. From ½ an Inch and under, in *Diameter* or *Length*, may be
accounted *Small*. From ½ an Inch and over to an Inch and ½, may go
for *Mean*. And from an Inch and v and over, *Great*.

17. In respect of the *Shape*, *Flowers* are *Open* or *Belly’d*. *Open* have
both *Leaves* and *Attire*, as most; or else are all *Attire*, as of *Burdock*,
*Beta Cretica*.

18. §. The *Open*, consist of a Certain Number of *Leaves*, *One*,
*Two*, *Three*, *Four*, *Five*, *Six*, *Seven*, *Eight*, *Nine*, *Ten*, *Thirteen*, or
*One* and *Twenty*. Uncertain, commonly called *Double*. Those of a
Certain *Number*, either *Uniform*, that is, all of a certain *Size* and
*Shape*, as usually; or *Biform*, or *Triform*, as in *Iris*, *Blattaria*. And
these again, Even *Edged* or *Notched*; with *Three Poynts*, as in *Marigold*;
or *Five*, in *Cichory*.

19. §. The *Belly’d*, are either so in whole; or in Part, that is,
with the *Top* divided into *Leaves*, and the *Bottom*, *Hollow*: The former,
are also Even *Edged*, as in *Convolvulus*; or *Notched*, as in *Trachelium*.
The latter have their *Leaves* distinguished as before. Their
*Bottom* or *Base*, either fastned to the *Seed-Case*, as in *Snap-dragon*; or
standing below it. And so, either Straight, as I think in *Toad-flax*;
or Crooked, as in *Violet*, *Lark-heel*.

20. §. In all these, the *Attire* is either *Seminiform*, or *Florid*. And
both, *Clustur’d*, or *Divided*; as in *Mallow*, *St. Johns wort*; *Starwort*,
*Hawkweed*.

21. §. The *Colours* of the *Flower*, are *White*, as in *Water-Crowfoot*;
*Red*, as *Lychnis*; *Blew*, as *Borage*; *Purple*, as *Stock-July Flower*; *Black*,
as in some *Anemones*; *Yellow*, in *Wall-Flower*; *Tawny*, in *Colus Jovis*;
*Green*, in *Laureola*. Which are either *Single*, or *Mixed*: *Two* together,
as in *Butyr-Bur*, *White* and *Red*; in *White Hellibore*, *White* and
*Green*; in *Monks Rubarb*, *Red* and *Green*; &c. Or *Three* together, as
in *Pancy*, *Yellow*, *Blew*, and *Black*, i.e. *atro-purpureus*.

22. §. How far these, and some other like *Distinctions*, being reduced
to *Tables*, would serve for the finding out of any Sort of *Plant*,
may be conceived, if we consider, how great a Variety, a few *Bells*, in
the ringing of Changes, will produce. And the search will be easy, and
successfull, if in every foregoing *Table*, reference be made to those that
follow; and in the *Tables* conteining the last *Divisions*, the Names of
the *Plants* therein poynted out, be expressed.
