## Act II

*The scene is unchanged, but it is evening. The curtains are drawn
        over the portholes, and the electric lights are on. The centre door
        is open from time to time, and it is pitch black outside.*

*On the left is seated* Mrs. Cliveden-Banks. Mr. Lingley *is
        with her, seated at the table on the right.*

Lingley. Well, I’m feeling very much better.

Mrs. C-Banks. I am so glad.

Lingley. I didn’t quite catch your name at dinner. Being
        introduced during the soup has its disadvantages. The lady sitting next
        to us made it a little difficult to hear concisely.

Mrs. C-Banks. Mrs. Cliveden-Banks. Yes, I foresaw trouble with
        her this morning. Er⁠—Mrs. Midget.

Lingley. Thank you. I say, Mrs. Midget⁠—

Mrs. C-Banks. No, no! No. *I* am Cliveden-Banks.

Lingley. I apologise. What strikes me is that this line can’t
        be paying any dividends⁠—Why there’s nobody on board.

Mrs. C-Banks. Bother dividends as long as I’m comfortable!

Lingley. This I think *is* the best place.

Mrs. C-Banks. Quite a jolly little snuggery. (The Reverend
        William Duke *enters and comes down centre.*) At least it
        *was*.

Lingley. Join me in a cigar, Duke?

Reverend W. Duke. Thank you.

Mrs. C-Banks (*after a glance at* Duke). And I was so
        comfortable. Where on earth can I go to now, I wonder? (*Rises.*)

Lingley. Oh! don’t go.

Duke. I hope you are not leaving on my account?

Mrs. C-Banks. Your hope is shattered, sir, I am.

Duke. Mrs. Cliveden-Banks, I don’t know what I’ve done to
        offend you. I can’t help being a parson. But I do know that you’ll make
        it very uncomfortable for the others if you go on like this. So come,
        look over my shortcomings just for the trip. Remember that to “err is
        human, to forgive divine.”

Mrs. C-Banks. Are you suggesting I have ever erred?

Duke. In your case, I am certain such a thing would be
        impossible.

Mrs. C-Banks. Oh! very well. I sacrifice myself for the
        others’ sake. I am a generous woman. How do you do? (*Shaking
        hands.*) But remember, Mr. Duke, if you *do* drown us all, I’ll
        never speak to you again. (*Sits left.*)

Duke. Splendid! (*Sits right of table right.*) Now, where
        are those other two? We might get up some bridge. We *must* all do
        something our first night out.

Mrs. C-Banks. What other two do you mean?

Duke. They⁠—er⁠—at dinner. They sat by themselves. Seemed
        awfully nice⁠—quiet. I don’t know their names⁠—I think the girl’s
        called Ann.

Mrs. C-Banks. Oh! that couple! Oh! dear! Did you like the look
        of *them*?

Duke. Yes, didn’t you?

Mrs. C-Banks. No, I thought there was something funny about
        them.

Lingley. “Funny”?

Duke. What do you mean by that?

Mrs. C-Banks. I don’t know. It just struck me they were funny.
        Not nice. I may be wrong. I hope I am. But that *is* my opinion.
        Not nice. Funny.

(Mrs. Midget *wanders in from the deck. Now hatless.*)

Mrs. Midget. May I come in?

Mrs. C-Banks. Now I *shall* go.

Duke (*rises*). Yes, come in, Mrs. Midget, come in.

Mrs. Midget (*entering*). It’s a bit lonely in the street.

Duke. “Street”?

Mrs. Midget. Out there.

Mrs. C-Banks. She means the deck⁠—how quaint.

Duke. It’s more cheerful in here, isn’t it?

Mrs. Midget. Oh, much. (*Advancing left centre.*)

Duke. Sit down. You’re not nervous, now, are you?

Mrs. Midget (*sits above table, right centre*). Not of
        you, sir. You wear just the same sort of collar as our parson does. I
        wish I was back in the Lambeth Road.

Mrs. C-Banks (*to* Lingley). I can’t stand the creature.
        I really can’t⁠—she’s too impossible. I shall squash her. Good evening,
        Mrs. Midget. We heard you at dinner. Very warm, this evening, isn’t it?

Mrs. Midget. Yes, dearie. ’Ellish ’ot. Beggin’ your
        Reverence’s pardon. I’ve come out all of a sweat. (*Wiping her neck
        with handkerchief.*)

Mrs. C-Banks. Dear me! Have you really? How embarrassing. What
        a day you have had, haven’t you? First of all you’re struck into a heap
        and now you’ve come out all of a⁠—yes, exactly. Yet, I suppose you
        travel a great deal?

Mrs. Midget. Every day. Lambeth to the Bank and from the Bank
        back to Lambeth. Workin’ in the City as I did⁠—do.

Mrs. C-Banks. The city! How enthralling! Big financial
        interests, I presume?

Mrs. Midget. No⁠—charrin’. And in the old times we always
        managed Margate in the summer. Nice spot, Margate, ain’t it?

Mrs. C-Banks. I know nothing against it. I have never been
        there, of course.

Mrs. Midget. Never been to Margate! (*To* Duke.) Would
        you believe it?

Duke. Yes.

Mrs. Midget. Oh! you’d love Margate a treat, mum. What with
        the paddling and everything. Do you like cocoanuts?

Mrs. C-Banks. Cocoanuts? Oh good Lord no!

Mrs. Midget. Ah! Then you mightn’t like Margate. They grow
        very good ones there though. At least they used to. Cors’ I ain’t been
        there since I lost all my money. Do you know, all of yer, believe me or
        believe me not, I once had a house of my very own.

Mrs. C-Banks. How magnificent!

Mrs. Midget. Yes, wasn’t it? Though of course it wasn’t
        *all* my own. No. Semi-detached, and lodgers yer know. Payin’
        guests and very well it *did* pay for donkey’s years. Well enough
        for me to make my son a gentleman anyway, and send him to a public
        school to prove it.

Mrs. C-Banks. Quite romantic. Perhaps I have met your dear
        boy? Where is he now? Cambridge or Cologne?

Mrs. Midget. Well, ’avin’ become a gentleman ’e naturally lost
        all ’is money. And ’is money was my money. And I ain’t seen him since.
        ’E hasn’t seen me, not to know me, since ’e was a little boy. I got my
        brother-in-law, ’e’s rich, to take him over and manage things for me.
        You see I didn’t want to disgrace ’im. ’E’s been a good boy.

Lingley. Sounds it.

Mrs. Midget (*resentfully*). ’E *was* I tell yer.
        But you know what it is yerself, sir.

Lingley. I do not⁠—I have never lost a penny in my life.

Mrs. Midget. Ah! then you can’t be a gentleman.

Lingley. What?

Mrs. Midget. Now the gentlemen my⁠—my boy mixed with
        *were* gents. Always broke, bless ’em, and then ’avin’ “another
        one” just to make ’em forget about it. And my boy the life and soul of
        the ’ole crowd. At least so the letter told me from the brother-in-law.
        And you can’t ’ave your cake and eat it, as the sayin’ goes, nor your
        gin and drink it *as* you well know, sir.

Lingley. Confound it, madam, I do *not* know.

Duke. Sorrow’s sent to try us, Mrs. Midget.

Mrs. Midget. Cors’ it’s sent to try us. What else could it be
        sent for. And it does try us very much.

Duke. Yes⁠—but sometimes as in your case⁠—

Mrs. C-Banks. Mr. Duke means you would never have the steady
        poise, you would not be the woman of the world you so obviously are
        unless⁠—

Mrs. Midget. You’re trying to pull my leg, aren’t you?

Duke. I’m afraid Mrs. Cliveden-Banks *was* trying to. I
        certainly didn’t mean that.

Mrs. Midget. Thank you, sir. (*Rises and crosses centre
        to* Mrs. Cliveden-Banks.) Mum, I may not know the manners of
        Society, and if them is such as yours I do *not* want to. With
        which terse remark I shuts up, being sorry for anything I’ve said.
        (*Moves up centre.*)

Duke. Yes, yes, quite, quite. Well, we must all *do*
        something you know, time is getting on. What about those cards?

Mrs. Midget (*coming down right*). Oh! I’d love a game o’
        nap. (*Sits.*) Mr. Prior was only telling me this afternoon before
        ’e⁠—well ’e was telling me that ’e played cards.

Lingley. Prior⁠—pooh!

Mrs. Midget. *I* like ’im anyway.

Duke. Very unfortunate⁠—Prior⁠—Yes, yes, dear, dear, dear.

Mrs. C-Banks. Poor Mr. Prior! But I hear he’s always like
        that nowadays. A thoroughly bad lot in fact. Not that I would say
        so in public of course⁠—but just between ourselves I mean. Oh!
        (*Laughs.*) What a sight he was and what an exhibition he made of
        himself. I shall never forget it. Never! (*Laughs again.*) Mr.
        Lingley, he called you a⁠—dear, dear me⁠—I can’t help smiling but he
        called you a⁠—(*laughs*) didn’t he?

Lingley. Never mind what he called me, madam.

Mrs. C-Banks. Well, you *are* rather like one you know,
        if you don’t mind my saying so. Where is he now, I wonder?

Lingley. Sleeping it off if he’s a wise man.

Duke. Which he isn’t.

Mrs. C-Banks. He wasn’t at dinner naturally. I expect you all
        noticed it.

Duke. Of course, of course. It’s a great shame, a great pity.
        (Tom *enters; he is very pale, tense and very quiet.*) Ah! Prior!

Mrs. C-Banks. Mr. Prior! Why, we were just talking about you⁠—

Tom. Indeed.

Mrs. C-Banks. Yes, I was only saying what a steady hand⁠—

Tom. Don’t waste any more of your breath than is absolutely
        necessary, Mrs. Cliveden-Banks. Nor any of you either.

Mrs. C-Banks. I beg your pardon.

Duke. What’s the matter now?

Tom. We’re trapped, that’s all.

Duke (*rises*). Trapped!

Tom. Yes, trapped. Every one of us⁠—all of us on this boat,
        we’re done for.

Mrs. C-Banks. What, *already*! (*Threateningly pointing
        to* Duke.) Mr. *Duke*!!⁠—

Tom. I mean it. You needn’t believe me if you don’t want to.
        It’s true all the same. We’re dead people.

Lingley. Oh, run away, run away, young man, and sleep it off.

Tom. I’m sober enough now. And the boat’s not sinking. I don’t
        mean that either.

Lingley. What the blazes *do* you mean then, sir?

Tom. Duke, come here. Feel my pulse. Draw a chalk line on the
        floor and make me walk it if you want to. (Duke *moves up right of
        table to him.*) Look at my eyes. Now⁠—I am sober, aren’t I?

Duke. Yes, I think so.

Tom. The last time I heard a clergyman say “Yes, I think so”
        was on the music-halls. Funny I shall never go to a Music Hall again.

Mrs. Midget (*rises*). Why doesn’t someone put the poor
        young man to bed? It would be much kinder.

Tom. Quiet please. I don’t want to frighten you⁠—any of
        you⁠—but I feel⁠—I ought to try and convince you. You admit I’m sober.
        You’ll have to take my word I’m not mad.

Lingley. I should want more than your word for that.

Tom. You shall have it. You shall have the word of the⁠—the
        man who calls himself a steward, and the words of two of our fellow
        passengers. The two whom I see are not here.

Lingley. But what about, sir? What are you driving at?

Tom (*comes down left centre*). I began to suspect this
        morning before lunch. Nobody seemed to know where they were going to.
        I’d forgotten myself, though I didn’t admit it. I didn’t want to.
        I didn’t dare to. I daren’t now. When I was quite convinced, I got
        drunk. That was only natural. All my life I’ve started to face facts
        by getting drunk. Well⁠—when⁠—when I woke up again⁠—about an hour ago,
        you were all in the saloon. I was frightened, terribly frightened. At
        last I got out of my cabin and went over the ship. I made myself. Yes,
        over her, all over her. Into the officers’ quarters and everything. No
        one said a word to me for a very simple reason. There’s no one on board
        *to* say anything. No captain, no crew, no nothing.

Mrs. C-Banks. If there’s *no* crew on board this ship,
        Mr. Prior, may I ask who waited on *me* at dinner.

Tom. There’s no one at all on board this ship, excepting
        we five⁠—and those two⁠—and the steward. *He* waited on you at
        dinner. He’s in charge of the ship. I made myself find out. Do you
        know where that steward is now? He’s in the rigging⁠—sitting cross
        legged⁠—high up in the rigging. I’ve just seen him.

Mrs. Midget. It’s takin’ ’im in a funny way, ain’t it?

Duke (*advancing on* Tom). Really, Prior, I think that⁠—

Tom (*turning to* Duke). I don’t know what I’m talking
        about? Very well, then, answer me this. Who have you, any of you, seen
        on board this ship since she sailed? Excepting ourselves? Mrs. Midget,
        perhaps you can help. (*Going to* Mrs. Midget.) When I sent you to
        your stewardess this morning, did you see her?

Mrs. Midget. See who? I saw no one except the fellow I went
        with. And first rate he looked after me. Got me a cup of tea and⁠—

Tom. I tell you I⁠—. (*Turns to* Duke.) Padre⁠—Padre,
        think carefully, who exactly have *you* spoken to?

Duke. I⁠—really, I⁠—I have seen men about of course.

Tom. Have you? Have you indeed? What sort of men, sailors?

Duke. Yes, I think so.

Tom. In the same way that you thought I was sober.

Mrs. C-Banks. You don’t expect us to talk to sailors, do you,
        Mr. Prior, able bodied though they may be.

Tom. Have any of you met anybody else then? A Purser, an
        officer of any sort, even a stoker?

Lingley. That reminds me. In your gigantic tour of this vessel
        did you by any chance strike the engine room?

Tom. No, I couldn’t find it.

Lingley. A pity! I’d hoped you were going to say the ship was
        worked by elastic⁠—ha, ha, ha.

(Mrs. Cliveden-Banks *laughs also.*)

Tom. Joke if you want to. If that *is* a joke. Well,
        Padre, speak up.

Duke. Well, I⁠—I must have met someone of course.

Tom. You *should* have met someone you mean. But you’ve
        not. Padre, where are *you* landing?

Duke. Landing? I’m going to⁠—of course I’m going to⁠—mind
        your own business.

Tom. *Where are you landing?*

Duke. I’m taking a little holiday that’s all. I’m going first
        to⁠—to⁠—

Tom. You see you can’t remember. I’m right! I knew I was. Why,
        look at the quiet way we sail. Was anybody here to see any of us off?
        No, you know they weren’t. Because you can’t see people off⁠—not right
        off⁠—to where we’re going.

Lingley. I wish you’d get out, sir, we want to play cards.

Tom. Cards⁠—pah! Lingley, Lingley, (*down to* Lingley)
        you’re impossible! Why I should try and warn *you*, I don’t know.
        Still can you really, honestly tell me you’ve seen nothing queer about
        this boat?

Lingley. Nothing whatever⁠—excepting you. She’s exactly the
        same as any other boat⁠—go away.

Tom. Is she? Is she indeed?

(Henry *and* Ann *appear at the centre door and cross down
        left. They are as ever, close together and almost always hand in
        hand, and aloof from the others.*)

Tom. Well, I’ll tell you one little thing I noticed about her
        that struck me as slightly different. This boat doesn’t carry a port
        light⁠—no⁠—and she doesn’t carry a starboard one either! *Now* is
        she the same as any other? *Now* can you settle down to your cards?

Lingley. You *are* mad?

Tom. Go and look then! Get on deck. You can find out if you go
        forward for yourself, and if you can see ’em⁠—you’re mad.

Lingley. I shouldn’t make such a fool of myself.

Tom (*seeing* Ann *and* Henry). Ah!⁠—you’re just in
        time.

Henry. What for?

Tom. To give these people their chance⁠—to stop them making
        fools of themselves⁠—to back me up.

Henry. I don’t quite follow.

Tom. You know⁠—you knew this morning.

Henry. Knew what?

Tom. You’ve been on deck?

Henry. Just now.

Tom. Notice anything wrong? (*A pause.*)

Henry. What with?

Tom. Oh! don’t pretend⁠—don’t lie to me.

Henry. Really, I *don’t* understand.

Tom. Then you don’t understand how you got here either I
        suppose? How either of you got here. (*Up to them.*) Gas, my dear
        sir, sheer gas.

Ann. Henry, don’t speak to him! (*Moves down a step.*) He
        frightens me.

Tom. Yes, I suppose I do. I know as well, you see.

Mrs. C-Banks. He’s trying to frighten us, that’s all.

Lingley. Madam, I must apologise for our fellow passenger.
        He⁠—he is not⁠—ahem⁠—well.

Tom (*moves down a step*). Of course I’m not well. Under
        the circumstances I should have thought that would have been obvious.

Lingley (*rises*). Mr. Duke, I see an unpleasant duty
        will have to be performed. As a clergyman you must be more used to
        unpleasantness than any of us. Will you please perform it.

Duke. What do you want me to do?

Lingley. Get him to the doctor⁠—or lock him up.

(Duke *moves slightly to centre door.*)

Tom (*up to centre door*). The doctor! I tell you there
        *is* no doctor. No one! And if you try any of that sort of thing
        on, I’ll make trouble.

Mrs. C-Banks. Oh, dear, how selfish.

Tom. But I tell you what you *can* do if you like⁠—

Lingley. Well?

Tom. I’ll make a bargain with you.

Lingley. What is it?

Tom. Go out there⁠—one of you men and convince yourselves
        about those lights. Then if I’m wrong⁠—well I’ll go quietly.

Mrs. Midget. That seems fair, poor fellow.

Tom. Well? What do you say? Mr. Lingley, will you oblige?

Lingley. I should never dream of interfering with the ship’s
        discipline.

Tom (*to* Henry). It’s no good asking *you*, of
        course?

Henry. No.

Tom. Padre⁠—you’re the only one left⁠—what do you say?

Duke. If I do it⁠—just to satisfy you⁠—you’ll keep your word.

Tom. Yes.

Duke. Very well then.

Lingley. Preposterous! (*Sits down.*)

Tom. Thank you. (Duke *goes slowly to doorway.*) Oh!
        Duke, the truth.

Duke. Of course.

(Duke *goes quietly out on to the deck.*)

Lingley. Weak, weak.

Mrs. C-Banks. Ah! the Church was always like that!

Tom. Don’t you run the Church down so. Take my advice, you
        may want her help very badly before long. (*Sits left of table
        right.*) Wait until I’m proved right.

Mrs. C-Banks. I simply ignore you, Mr. Prior. You won’t be
        right. That is why I ignore you.

(Drake’s *drum is faintly heard, a heavily muffled and mysterious
        and irregular beating.*)

Lingley. Childish weak foolishness giving in to you.
        *I’ve* never given into anyone. No one’s ever given in to me.
        I should never expect them to. You’re drunk, sir, and you’re in the
        wrong, sir and⁠—

(*The Drum stops.*)

Tom. Quiet. (*Rises.*) I can hear something⁠—out there.

Henry. What is it?

Tom. Wait a minute⁠—it’s stopped now.

Lingley. I didn’t hear anything.

Tom. I did. It sounded like a drum.

Lingley. A drum?

Tom. Yes. A muffled drum.

Mrs. C-Banks. Very possibly it *was* a muffled drum.

Lingley. Very possibly it was imagination.

Mrs. C-Banks. What’s the good of talking about things out
        there in the cold, anyway. Let’s concentrate on making it nice and
        comfortable in here for our cards, (*to* Tom) which we hope to
        start the moment you’ve gone.

Tom (*moving towards her*). Mrs. Cliveden-Banks, you’re
        an ostrich! I’m sorry, but you are. You’re in danger, great danger of
        something out there⁠—something I don’t know what it is⁠—but it may
        affect your very soul⁠—yet all you can think about is light and warmth
        and cards in here. So the only word for you *is* ostrich.

Lingley (*smiling*). Dear me, dear me, I can’t help
        smiling but he called you a⁠—didn’t he?

Ann (*looking out on to the deck*). Oh! why doesn’t he
        come back? (*In terrified impatience.*)

Henry. Steady, steady. (*To others.*) My wife is easily
        upset. (*Draws her away from door left.*)

Mrs. Midget. Poor dear.

Lingley. It’s too bad of you, Prior.

Tom. Is it?

Ann. What has happened to him?

Tom. To whom?

Ann. The clergyman⁠—of course.

Tom. Oh! Duke. Who knows? Perhaps he can’t get back. He’s only
        been a second away.

Ann. You don’t think⁠—(*Drum starts again, beating
        irregularly and a trifle more loudly.*)

Tom. I don’t think, because I don’t know any more than you do.
        Hark! (*A pause.*) Listen, there it is again. The drum!

Lingley. Um! *I* must be getting deaf!

(Duke *appears as if breathless⁠—a pause⁠—He is pale and agitated,
        terrified⁠—but tries to conceal it.*)

Tom (*tensely anxious*). Well⁠—well?

Lingley. Well⁠—speak, Mr. Duke. (*A pause.*)

Ann (*with a great effort at dissembling*). It’s⁠—it’s
        all right, of course.

Lingley. Duke? (*Another pause.*) It *is* all right?

Duke. Of course.

Lingley. Everything?

Duke. Everything.

(*Drum stops.*)

Mrs. C-Banks. I knew it would be all the time.

Tom (*rushing up and throwing himself on* Duke).
        You liar! You liar! Come with me⁠—I’ll show you. (*Grabs him by
        throat.*)

(Lingley *rises.*)

Duke (*struggling with him*). Prior! (Mrs. Midget
        *rises.* Lingley *seizes* Tom’s *neck.* Ann *and*
        Henry *up left huddled together in alarm.*) You promised to go
        quietly.

Tom. You swore to tell the truth! *You clergyman*, you
        dirty liar!

Duke. Got him, Lingley?

Tom (*struggling violently*). I’ll show you! No
        more lies! Now we’re dead, you bloody liar! I won’t be cheated! I
        *will* make you understand! I’m trying to help I tell you⁠—help us
        all!!!

Lingley. Be quiet, sir.

(*They bring* Tom *to chair left of table right. He sinks to
        chair and with head buried in arms on table sobs hysterically but
        quietly⁠—exhausted.*)

Mrs. C-Banks. If wanted, I’ll be in the Ladies’ Writing Room.
        (*Going left.*) A long letter you know, while the details are
        still fresh. (*Turns.*) Coming dear? (*Sees she is speaking
        to* Mrs. Midget⁠—*Turns at door.*) Oh no! (*She goes out with
        her nose in the air.*)

(Mrs. Midget *crosses and Exits left following* Mrs.
        Cliveden-Banks. *All stand quietly for a moment’s pause.*)

Henry (*to* Ann). Dear?

Ann (*as she goes*). I’ll wait on deck.

Lingley (*to* Henry). Shut those doors.

(Henry *closes centre door.*)

Lingley. *And now, sir.*

Duke (*coming down to* Prior). Prior. I apologise.

Lingley. What do you mean?

Duke. That Mr. Prior was perfectly right.

Lingley. What?

Duke. There *is* no⁠—there’s no starboard⁠—no⁠—

Lingley. There’s *not*!

Duke. No. There’s no light on the boat at all. She’s as black
        as pitch.

Lingley. Impossible.

Duke. Look for yourself.

Lingley (*alarmed now, crosses to centre door, opens it
        and glances out into the dark, then shuts it. Then hesitates and
        turns*). But⁠—the bridge?

Duke. As far as I could see there’s nothing⁠—nothing anywhere.

Lingley. Nothing⁠—nobody?

Duke. I’m not even certain that we’re moving.

Lingley (*coming back*). Good heavens, man, why didn’t
        you tell us this at once?

Duke. I didn’t want to alarm the ladies.

Lingley. Women drown as easily as men.

Duke. Is this a question of drowning? Something must be
        done⁠—we must all do something immediately. (*Sits right of table
        right.*)

Tom. Exactly, but what?

Lingley (*thoroughly rattled*). To begin
        with⁠—well⁠—somebody⁠—somebody ought to ring a bell.

Tom. And get someone else to explain.

Lingley. Duke⁠—do you⁠—do you believe in all this?

Duke. I don’t understand it.

Lingley (*to* Henry). And you, sir?

Henry. I don’t understand it either.

Tom. That’s not true! (*Rises.*) And you know it’s not
        true!

Duke. Prior! Now look here, when did you first feel certain,
        in your mind, about all this?

Tom (*pointing at* Henry⁠—*sits on table*).
        After I’d heard something he said. I spoke to the steward, I asked
        him if⁠—he told me the truth I’m sure⁠—it seems we’re sailing for
        (*pause*)⁠—both Hell and Heaven.

Duke. Very interesting from a professional point of view of
        course.

Tom. If there’s anything else you want to know better ask
        *him, the steward*.

Duke. Where is he now I wonder?

Lingley. Still sitting high up in the rigging I expect.

Tom. Don’t be sarcastic! He was there.

Lingley. Was he? (*Rises, takes one step towards* Tom.)
        Then how did you see him if it’s all dark outside?

Tom (*vaguely*). That never struck me. But he was there.

(Scrubby *enters, softly strolls across towards centre.*)

Duke (*rises*). We must hurry. Whilst we’re talking like
        this we may be drifting on to the rocks⁠—crashing into something or⁠—

Scrubby (*always very kindly, very quiet and
        compassionate⁠—like a tolerant elder to children*). No, sir, you
        won’t do that.

Lingley. Now look here, my man. What is all this nonsense? I
        can’t stand excitement. My doctor ordered rest and quiet. Where’s the
        Captain? Take me to him!

Scrubby. Oh, he left long ago, sir.

Lingley. Enough of that! Understand? By Gad when I get back to
        London I’ll report⁠—

Scrubby. I’m afraid you won’t get back to London, sir⁠—

Lingley. No more of your impertinence! Take me to the
        Captain!⁠—do you hear?⁠—you’re only a damned servant⁠—take me to him⁠—

Duke. Mr. Lingley, I think we should *all* keep our
        tempers.

Scrubby. That’s all right, sir, I’ve known a lot of them to
        get angry at first.

Lingley. A lot of whom?

Scrubby. People like you, sir, who are just beginning.

Lingley. Beginning?

Scrubby. To be passengers.

Tom. What you told me this morning *was* true, wasn’t it?

Scrubby. That we’re dead, sir? Yes, quite dead if that’s what
        you mean.

Lingley. You speak for yourself.

Duke. It *is* queer. (*Sits right of table right.*)

Scrubby. Why, sir? We didn’t think it was queer when we were
        born.

Lingley. Now listen. I don’t want any mysteries.

Scrubby. There are none, sir.

Lingley. And I mean to get in touch with someone at once⁠—ah!
        I have it, the wireless!

Scrubby. She doesn’t carry any, sir.

Lingley. That’s illegal anyway! Duke? (*A pause.*) Duke?

Duke. I’m afraid I can’t suggest anything.

Lingley. But⁠—but⁠—! (*Suddenly overcome with fear.*) I
        must get out of this⁠—I must get out of it.

Scrubby. That, sir, is impossible until after the examination.

Lingley. What examination?

Scrubby. You’ll find out later, sir.

Lingley. The ladies ought to be warned immediately.

Scrubby. I should leave them to find out for themselves,
        sir, if I were you. I have known some of them not to like the idea to
        begin with and get hysterical. It is kinder to let them find out for
        themselves.

Duke. They will find out?

Scrubby. Undoubtedly, sir.

Lingley (*suddenly seeing* Henry). Damn it⁠—don’t stand
        there saying nothing⁠—get upset!

Henry. I am⁠—of course.

Lingley. You’re a bright lot all of you, aren’t you? So
        helpful⁠—but⁠—but⁠—what are we to do? What are we to do? (*To*
        Duke.) *You’re* always talking about doing things? What are we to
        do?

Duke. I really⁠—don’t know. Of course, if we were all quite
        certain⁠—a prayer⁠—

Lingley. Is praying going to bring the captain or the crew to
        life?

Tom. Or any of us, for that.

Scrubby. There’s no danger, gentlemen, if *that’s* what
        you’re frightened of.

Lingley. Isn’t there?

Scrubby. No, sir.

Lingley. *I’m* not frightened.

Duke. I am. How many times have *you* made this passage,
        steward?

Scrubby. About five thousand times, sir.

Lingley. Five⁠—

Scrubby. Yes. I was lost young.

Duke. And it’s always been like this?

Scrubby. Not always, sir. No. As I was telling this gentleman
        (*referring to* Prior), the passengers don’t find out so quickly
        as a rule. I suppose it’s because of the half-ways we’ve got on board
        this trip.

Duke. Half-ways?

Scrubby. Yes, sir, it sometimes *does* work like that.

Lingley. There is no point in standing here talking to a
        lunatic. The question is⁠—“What is⁠—?”

Scrubby. ⁠—to be done? That’s what they *all* ask,
        sir. There’s *nothing* to be done. Just go on as if nothing had
        happened.

Tom. How simple.

Scrubby. Quite, sir, quite. You’ll find everything simple now.
        Until it comes to the examination.

Lingley. Don’t talk to me as if I were a schoolboy.

Scrubby. It *is* rather like going to school, sir.

Lingley. Stop! It’s all right. Everything’s all right. I’ve
        solved the whole thing suddenly.

Henry. Have you? (*Still up left aloof.*)

Lingley. Of course I have. I’m asleep. I’m safe really. I’m
        simply asleep.

Tom. What am I?⁠—part of the nightmare?

Lingley. I’ve had dreams like this before. Go away, go away,
        all you people. It’s no good you waiting! I’m Lingley of Lingley Ltd.
        Not one of you can touch me. I turned myself into a company years ago.
        Only go away now. (*A pause and then he turns to the steward.*)
        *I am asleep*, aren’t I?

Scrubby. Yes, sir⁠—sound asleep⁠—or just waking.

Lingley. Good, good. Now get away, get away all you people. I
        shall go. I will go. (*Crosses to door left.*) Isn’t that lucky! I
        *can* go. You know, in *some* dreams, you *can’t*.

(Lingley *walks off left.*)

Scrubby (*following him*). Don’t worry, gentlemen, I’ll
        look after him.

(Scrubby *follows him.*)

Duke. A good sleep would be the very best thing for
        Lingley.

Tom. Would it?

Duke. Eh?

Tom. Well, I mean⁠—you know⁠—would it help now?

Duke. Oh! yes, of course⁠—I’d forgotten⁠—I really don’t know.
        I⁠—I don’t understand. I’m quite a young man and there’s such a lot of
        work to be done after my holiday.

Tom. Try some of this whisky⁠—it still seems to work.

Duke (*rises*). No, I don’t think I will if you’ll excuse
        me, in case we⁠—we meet anyone.

Tom (*toying idly with glass*). I’m awfully sorry. I’m
        afraid I’m a fearful rotter, I’m so used to it. Any crises you⁠—(*He
        puts down the glass. Both sit on front of table.*) I say⁠—I
        say⁠—(*Pause.*) Charles Reid⁠—or some other rotten novelist once
        said “Never too late to mend,” didn’t he? Do you think there’s any
        truth in novels? And then there was that other chap⁠—the Great One, you
        know, in the Bible, he said⁠—he⁠—There you are, you see; that’s the
        sort of fellow I am! I’ve forgotten what *he* said.

Duke. Does it really much matter what either of them said?
        Isn’t it more to the point what *you* have got to say?

Tom. No sermons! But, if you please, I would like to talk to
        you seriously if you’d listen to me, out there in the dark.

Duke (*rises*). Shall we go out there⁠—in the dark⁠—and
        talk to each other, shipmate?

Tom (*humorously*). This is a great chance for
        *you*, isn’t it?

Duke. We must both, my dear Prior, keep our sense of humour.
        (*Moves up to door centre. To* Henry *at door*). Coming out,
        sir? (*With* Tom *to door arm in arm.*)

Henry. No, not yet. (*Still up left.*)

Duke. See you later then. (*He goes out.*)

Henry. Yes.

Tom. I say, your wife’s out there, isn’t she?

Henry. Yes.

Tom. Shall I send her to you?

Henry. Oh⁠—thank you.

Tom (*returning a step from door*). You must have known
        or you wouldn’t have let her be out there alone.

Henry. I knew *nothing*. I know nothing now, Good-night.

Tom. I suppose so. (*He walks out on to the deck and
        disappears. There is a pause and then* Henry *calls* “Ann.”
        *Another pause. He calls again.* Ann *enters from the deck.*)

Henry. Ann⁠—(*A pause.*) Come here. (*Crosses right to
        above table.*)

Ann. What is it? (*She goes to left of* Henry.)

Henry. Come here.

Ann. I’m with you.

Henry. Ann⁠—listen⁠—they know we’re dead⁠—they’re⁠—they’re
        finding out our secret.

Ann (*frightened*). I know! I know they are! (*They
        look at each other.*)

Henry. What will they *do* to us dear?

Ann (*getting closer to him*). They won’t separate
        us⁠—will they?

Curtain.
