 is the part of a *Physician*, knowingly and artificially
    to use and govern *Nature*. And therefore
    by every likely *Method*, to inspect the *State* and
    *Properties* of all sorts of *Bodies*. One *Method*, is
    that I have taken in the foregoing *Experiments*;
    *sc.* by mixing them with several *Menstruums* or *Liquors*:
    whereby we may be assisted to judge,
    both of the *Kinds* and the *Proportions* of *Principles*
    in any *Body*; and of the manner of their *Mixture* in the same.

Another is by *Calcining* them; or, as it were, by *mixing* them with
    the *Fire*, a potent and almost universal *Menstruum*. I shall here only
    set down some *Tryals* for an *Essay*, upon *Plants*; chiefly noting, The
    different *Proportions* of their *Lixivial Salts*. Of these *Tryals*, some

    were made upon the whole *Plant*, or some *Portion* of it wherein several
    *Parts* are mixed together: And others, upon some one *Part* of a *Plant*
    distinct from the rest. All of them answering to such *Queries*, as may
    seem proper to be proposed.

Query 1. As first, *Whether Trees or Herbs and Bushes, quantity for
    quantity* & cæteris paribus, *yield the most Lixivial Salt?*

For this I took *Ash-Barque* and *Rosemary* of each ℔j. The latter
    yielded 5 *Scruples*; the former but 32 *Grains*; which is three times less.
    I took also the same quantity of the *Barque* of *Black-Thorn*, and of *Agrimony*.
    The latter yielded 5 *Scruples* and 6 *Grains*; the former, not
    above 1 *Scruple* and 5 *Grains*; which is four times less.

Although the *Barque* of a *Tree* be compounded of *Pithy* and *Lignous
    Parts*; yet to answer the *Query* exactly, the *Wood* of these *Trees* should
    be taken with the *Barque*, that there may be some portion of every
    *Part* of the *Tree*, as well as of the *Herb*.

But thus far the *Experiment* is *conclusive*, That the same quantity of
    *Lixivial Salt*, doth not always follow the same *Generical Tast*. For the
    *Barque* of *Ash* and *Rosemary*, are both equally *Bitter*; and the *Barque*
    of *Black-Thorn* and *Agrimony* are both *Astringent* and *Bitter*.

Quer. 2. *Whether any Plant growing in a Garden or the Field, doth
    not yield a lesser quantity of Lixivial Salt, than another of the same kindred
    growing on the Sea-Coast; and with what difference?*

For this, I took *Garden* and *Sea-Scurvygrass*, of each ℔j. The former
    yields 2 *Drachms* and 1 *Scruple*; the latter, being well washed,
    9 *Drachms*, which is more than 4 times as much. The like may be
    tryed upon others.

Quer. 3. *Whether the same Specifick Plant affords more Lixivial
    Salt, being only dryed, and then calcin’d, or after it hath first been distilled,
    it is then dryed and calcin’d?*

For this, was taken ℔j of *Mint* only dryed and then calcin’d; and
    another first distilled. The former yielded ½ an Ounce and ½ a
    Drachm of *Salt*; the latter, 5 Drachms and a Scruple; which is almost
    ⅕ᵗʰ more. This also should be tryed on other *Plants*.

Quer. 4. *How far the proportion follows the different Tasts of Plants?*
    The first Experiment, relates to the same *Tast* in several *Plants*; this,
    to several Tasts. And so,

Of *Majorane*, which is *Aromatick*, ℔j affords but one Scruple of *Lixivial
    Salt*; which is but the 384ᵗʰ part of the whole pound.

Of *Oak-Barque* which is *Astringent*, ℔j yields ½ a Drachm of *Salt*;
    or the 256ᵗʰ part of the whole.

Of *Liquirish*, which is sweet, ℔j yields about the same quantity.
    But *Anise Seeds* ℔j yields 2 Scruples or a 192ᵈ part.

Of *Sorrel*, which is sower, ℔j yields one Drachm, or the 128ᵗʰ part.

Of *Garden Scurvygrass*, which is *Hot*, ℔j yields 2 Drachms and ½ a
    Scruple; or the 59ᵗʰ part.

Of *Mint*, which is *Hot* and *Bitter*, ℔j yields 5 Drachms and a Scruple,
    or the 24ᵗʰ part.

Of *Sea Scurvygrass*, which is *Salt*, ℔j yields 9 Drachms and a Scruple
    or 28 Scruples; which is near 1/13ᵗʰ part of the whole. A greater
    proportion of *Salt*, than in any other *Plant* upon which I have hitherto
    made Tryal: Or even in *Tartar* it self. Yet is it not a *Marine*, but
    true *Lixivial Salt*: as is evident, both from its *Taste*; and in that it

    maketh an *Effervescence* with *Spirit* of *Salt*; which *Sea-Salt* will
    not do.

For the Experiment to be fully adequate to the *Query*; the *Tryals*
    should be made, either all on *Trees*, or all on *Herbs*; all on *Roots*, or all
    on *Stalks*, &c. Yet thus much is evident, That *Sorrel* yields Thrice as
    much as *Majorane*; *Sea-Scurvygrass*, Eight and Twenty times as much:
    *Mint*, Five times as much as *Sorrel*; and Sixteen times as much *Majorane*,
    &c.

Quer. 5. *How far the Proportion follows the Faculties of Plants?*
    And so, it appears, that

*Majorane*, a *Cephalick*, hath a greater *Proportion* of *Volatile Parts*, than
    any of the *Plants* above mentioned, and so far, is more agreeable to the
    *Animal Spirits*, and *Genus Nervosum*.

*Agrimony*,[76] an *Aperient*, yields above Five times as much *Lixivial
    Salt*, as *Majorane*. Yet much less than many other opening *Plants*
    which are stronger.

[76]
 *Quer. 1.*

*Mugwort* (℔j) yields two Drachms and two Scruples; or above half
as much more as *Agrimony*. So that this *Plant*, though it hath no considerable
*Taste*, and in that respect promiseth but little; yet yielding a
good quantity of *Lixivial Salt*, seems no contemptible *Medicine* to subdue
those *Acidities* which either by causing *Obstructions*, or immoderate
*Fermentations*, frequently disorder the *Female Sex*.

*Mint*, yieldeth still a greater quantity; and is therefore, partly for
the same cause so excellent a *Stomachick*: And *Rosemary*,⁠[77] which is appropriated
both to the *Head* and *Stomach*, yieldeth a midle quantity
of *Salt*; more than the chief *Cephalicks*, and less than the chief *Stomachicks*.

[77]
 *Quer. 1.*

*Common Mallow* (℔j) yields 5 Drachms and 2 Scruples. *i. e.* the 23ᵈ
part of the whole. So that this *Plant*, though of a very mild *Taste*,
yet yields more *Salt* than *Mint* it self a *Bitter Plant*. Whereby it no
longer seems strange, that a *Plant* of so soft a *Taste*, should be very
*Diuretick*, and so evidently affect the *Reins*.

*Rhubarb* (2 Ounces) yieldeth scarce any fixed *Salt*, so for as can be
judged by the *Taste* of the *Ashes*, not more than a Grain or two. So
that its *Salt* is, in a manner, wholly volatile; and thereby apter to
operate upon the *Bilious* parts of the *Blood*; which contein a far greater
proportion of *Volatile Salt*, than do the *Serous*.

Of the *Caput Mortuum* or meer *Earth*, it is observable, that it
was near ½ an Ounce or ¼ᵗʰ part of the whole; Which is almost Six
times as much as the *Caput Mortuum* of *Common Dock*: and much more
than that of any other *Root* I have yet calcin’d. Whereby it seemeth
probable that *Rhubarb* looseth much of its *Volatile Part*, and therefore
of its *Virtue*, before it comes to our *Shops*.

*Sena* (℔j) yields 4 Scruples and ½ of *Salt*; or the 85ᵗʰ part.

*Jalap* (℔j) yields but one Drachm and 15 Grains, or 102ᵈ part.

*Colocynthis* (℔j of the *Pulp*) yields an Ounce and half of *Caput
Mortuum*, which is almost all *Salt*. Yet allow half an Ounce of the *Salt*,
and *Earth* to be wasted in filtring &c. the remaining Ounce is no less
than 1/16ᵗʰ part of the whole. Which is more than in any of the
above named *Plants*, except the *Sea-Scurvygrass*.
