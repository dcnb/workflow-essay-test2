### CHAP. II.

### In which is shewed, that by the Solution of Salts in Water,
some certain space, more or less, is gained. That
the space is different according to the Nature of the Salt.
And what the just space is, which is gained.

HE
 *Fifth* Enquiry is, Whether by dissolving of
a *Salt* in *Water*, there be any space gained, or
not. That is, whether the *Bulk* of the *Water* be
greater before the *Salt* lying in it be fully dissolved,
than afterwards. For tryal whereof, I
took a *Bolt-head* with a slender *Neck*, holding
somewhat more than a pint; and filling it up to
a certain place in the *Neck*; I then put in an
Ounce or two of *Salt*. And observing the hight
of the *Water*, both before it was dissolved, and afterwards; It plainly
appeared, that there was some, and that a considerable space, gained
by the *Dissolution*; the *Water* thereby sinking several Inches below
the place, where it stood after the *Salt* was first put into it.

2. §. From this Experiment it is plain, that there are *Vacuities* in
*Water*. That is to say, that all the parts of *Water* are not contiguous,
but that either betwixt, or in the *Atomes* of the *Water* themselves, there
are certain *Pores*, either absolutely void, or at least filled up with another
more subtile body which is easily excluded by the particles of
*Salt*: by possessing the room of which the above said space is gained.

3. §. The *Sixth* Enquiry is, Whether the space be equally gained,
by an equal encrease of the same *Salt*.

4. §. For this I made two tryals; the first was this. Two half
Ounces of *Salt Armoniac*, being successively dissolved in the same *Water*;
both of them raised up the *Water* in the *Neck* of the *Bolt-head*, equally;
the first 3 Inches ⅝, and so the second.

5. §. The other was this. Four half Ounces of *Nitre*, being successively
dissolved in the same *Water*, they all of them raised up the
*Water* in the *Neck* of the *Bolt-head*, equally; the first a little above
two Inches, and the 2ᵈ, 3ᵈ, and 4ᵗʰ, just as much.

6. §. The *Seventh* Enquiry is, Whether upon the *Dissolution* of
several kinds of *Salts*, be gained so many several quantities of space.
For this I made tryal upon Eleven several *Salts*, sc. *Salt* of *Tartar*,
*Common Salt*, *Sal Gemmeus*, *Roman Vitriol*, *Nitre*, *White Vitriol*, *Green
Vitriol*, *Alum*, *Borax*, *Loaf-Sugar*, and *Sal Armoniac*; of all which, I
dissolved an equal quantity *sc.* two Ounces, in an equal quantity of
*Water*, severally; that is, taking fresh *Water* for every *Solution*. The
success was, That the *Sal Armoniac* raised the *Water* 15 Inches. The
*Loaf-Sugar*, 13 Inches and ⅜ᵗʰˢ· The *Borax*, a Foot. The *Alum* 11
Inches, and ⅝ᵗʰˢ. *Green Vitriol*, 9 Inches and ⅝ᵗʰˢ· *White Vitriol*, 9
Inches and ⅛ᵗʰ. *Nitre*, 8 Inches, and ⅜ᵗʰˢ· *Roman Vitriol*, 7 Inches

and ⅝ᵗʰˢ· *Sal Gemmæ*, 6 Inches, and ⅝ᵗʰˢ· *Common Salt*, 6 Inches and
⅜ᵗʰˢ· *Salt* of *Tartar*, not above 4 Inches and ⅛ᵗʰ. All which differences
are plain, and most of them very remarquable: Two Ounces of *Sal
Armoniac* raising the *Water* near four times as high, as the same quantity
of *Salt* of *Tartar*.

7. §. From this and the fourth Experiment, compared, it also appears,
That the several spaces gained by the several *Salts*, though sometimes
they do, yet do not always answer to the *Solubility* of the said
*Salts*. As to give some Instances; *Loaf-Sugar* is the most dissoluble of
any other *Salt*; yet it gaineth less space than all the rest, save only
*Sal Armoniac*. So *Green Vitriol* is more dissoluble then either *Nitre*
or *Common Salt*; yet gaineth less space than either, especially than the
latter. And *Sal Armoniac*, which is more dissoluble than *Alum* or *Borax*,
yet gaineth less space than either of them. The *Cause* whereof
is not easily assigned.

8. §. Note also, that by the same Experiment, as well as by the
*Taste* and other Circumstances, it is plain, That *Sal Gemmæ* is nothing
else but *Common Salt*, coagulated or *Crystalliz’d* under *Ground*.

9. §. Again, as the Fifth Experiment sheweth, That there are
*Vacuities* in *Water*: so doth this Last, that those *Vacuities*, are of differing
kinds. Because, otherwise, it should seem, That the *Bulk* of the
*Water* would increase, more or less, according to the *Solubilitie* of every
*Salt*, and not be alternately differenced as it is; Some *Salts*, more
dissoluble, increasing the *Bulk* of the *Water* less, and others less dissoluble,
increasing it more. I say, that this difference dependeth not
only upon the different *Figures* of the *Atomes* of *Salt*; because then
every *Salt* which is more dissoluble, would (quantity for quantity)
take up less room in the *Water*: which is contrary to the Experiment.

10. §. From the same Experiment, howsoever *paradoxical* it may
seem, yet is it also manifest, That although *Water* be a *Fluid*, yet the
*Particles* thereof are *hard* and *consistent*, and unalterable in their *Figure*.
Otherwise it is plain, That all manner of *Salts* would be dissolved in
the same manner, and take up the same room in the *Water*. For let
the *Figures* of the *Salts* be never so various, yet if the *Particles* of
*Water* were themselves *Fluid* or *Inconsistent* and *Alterable*, they would
always so conforme to those *Figures*, as to fill up all *Vacuities*; and so
upon the *Solution* of several *Salts*, if of equal quantity, the *Water*
would still retein an equal *Bulk*. As suppose an Ounce of *Iron* were
drawn into *Wyer*, another beaten into *Plates*, a third made into *Hooks*,
a fourth into *Needles*, a fifth into *Nails*; every one of these five Ounces,
being put severally into *Water* will encrease its *Bulk* equally. I
conclude therefore, That the *Atomes* of *Water* are hard and unalterable.

11. §. The *Eighth* Enquiry was this, What that just space
might be, which any *Salt* gaineth upon *Dissolution*, with respect to its
own *Bulk*, or the *Bulk* of the *Water*? For the making of this Experiment,
*Water* will not serve, nor yet *Spirit* of *Wine*; because they both
of them dissolve more or less of those *Salts* which are put into them;
whereby the observation of the true *Bulk* of the *Salt*, and consequently
of the just space it gaineth by *Dissolution* is lost. I took therefore *Oyl*
of *Turpentine*, and pouring it into a *Bolt-head*, marked the place of
its ascent in the *Neck*. Then pouring likewise into it two Ounces of

*Common Salt*, I marked the second ascent of the *Oyl*; and found it to
be 10 Inches and 6 eighths. Repeating the Experiment in like manner
with two Ounces of *Nitre*, I found the ascent of the *Oyl* to be 11 Inches
and ⅛ᵗʰ. Repeating it again with two Ounces of *Alum*, the ascent of
the *Oyl* was 13 Inches and 2/8ᵗʰˢ· And making it once more with *Sal
Armoniac*, the *Oyl* ascended to 15 Inches: the said several ascents of the
*Oyl* being the true spaces which the Four abovesaid *Salts* take. From
which, the space which the same *Salts* take up upon *Dissolution*, being
deducted; the remainder is the space gained by that *Dissolution*.
And so it appears, first, that *Sal Armoniac* gaineth nothing; being the
only *Salt* of all I have tryed, which causeth the equal ascent both of the
*Water* and the *Oyl* *sc.* just 15 Inches in both. *Alum* causeth the ascent
of the *Oyl* to 13-2/8ᵗʰˢ, of the *Water*, to 11 Inches and ⅝ᵗʰˢ: So that it
gains about 1 Inch and ½ out of 13. *Nitre* causeth the ascent of the
*Oyl*, to 11 Inches and ⅛ᵗʰ; of the *Water*, to 8 Inches and ⅜ᵗʰˢ· So that
*Nitre* by *Dissolution* gets almost the space of 3 Inches in 11. *Common
Salt* causeth the ascent of the *Oyl*, to 10 Inches and 6/8ᵗʰˢ; of the *Water*,
6 Inches and ⅜ᵗʰˢ· So that *Common Salt* gains by *Dissolution* 4 Inches in
10, which is very considerable.

12. §. By this way the *Specifick Gravity* of all kinds of *Salts* may
be easily taken, and the difference betwixt them is somewhat surprizing.
For it appears by the Ascent of the *Oyl*, that *Nitre*, quantity
for quantity, is about a 22ᵗʰ part lighter than *Common Salt*. *Alum*
about a 6ᵗʰ part lighter. And *Salt Armoniac*, almost a 4ᵗʰ part lighter
than *Common Salt*. The like estimate may be made of the *Gravity* of
all other *Salts*.

13. §. By the same Experiment it also appears, That according to
the *Specifick Gravity* of *Salts* they are many times at least more or
less *Volatile*; as in the four last *Salts* is plain. For *Common Salt* which
of all the four is the most fixed, is also the heavyest. *Nitre* which is
somewhat less fixed is somewhat lighter. But *Alum* which is still less
fixed is much lighter. And *Sal Armoniac* which is wholly *Volatile*, is
the lightest of all the *Salts* above mentioned.
