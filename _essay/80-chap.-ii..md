### CHAP. II.

### Of the DURATION and several TERMES
    of Tasts.

HE
next general way of distinguishing *Tasts*, is by
their *Duration*, and their *Terms*, or their *Motion*
of *Intension* and *Remission* from one *Degree* to
another. For there are many *Tasts*, which have
their *Motions* analogous to those of *Diseases*; and
by those may be distinguished in the same manner.
For as of *Diseases*, so of *Tasts*, there are Four
*Times*, as *Physicians* call them, or *Terms* of *Motion*;
sc. *Principium*, *Augmentum*, *Status*, *& Declinatio*.

2. §. For the distinct observing of which, those *Bodies* which are
hard, and so their tastable parts less easily extractable by the *Tongue*,
should be reduced to a fine *Powder*: otherwise, the true measure of the

*Principium* will be lost. And for the precise measuring of all the *Four
Termes*, it should be done by a *Minute-Watch* or a *Minute-Glass*. For
so it will appear, that the *Variations* of each, are divers and remarquable.

3. §. To instance first in those of the *Principium*. Which I call,
That space of time, betwixt the first *Contact* of the *Body* to be tasted,
and the first manifest *Perception* of the *Taste*. For Example, those
*Bodies* which are *Acid*, or *Bitter*, as *Vinegar* or *Wormwood*, are presently
perceiv’d, *quatenus Acid* or *Bitter*, upon the first *Contact*; or
have *Principium brevissimum*. Those *Bodies* which are *Acrid*, have
their *Principium* somewhat longer. So the *Seed Cases* of *Clematis
peregrina*, although they have a vehement *Acritude*, even in the Tenth
*Degree*; yet is not that *Acritude* so soon tasted, as the *Bitterness*
of *Roses*, which is but in the second. But the *Principium* of *Hot
Tasts*, is generally longer than that of any other. So the *Bitterness*
of the *Root* of *Black-Hellebore*, which exceedeth not the second *Degree*,
is yet presently tasted: but the *Heat* proceeding from the same
*Root*, and which ascendeth to the third *Degree*, is not perceived at all,
till after two full *Minutes*. And so the *Bitterness* of *Enula*, which exceedeth
not the 4ᵗʰ *Degree*, yet is sooner tasted than its *Heat*, which
ascendeth to the 8ᵗʰ.

4. §. Next, in those of the *Augment*. Which I call, That space,
betwixt the first *Perception* of the *Taste*, till it be come to the heighth.
So the *Heat* of *Galangale*, is not only presently perceived, but ariseth to
the heighth within half a *Minute*. But the *Heat* of the *Root* of *Enula*,
comes not to the heighth till after a whole *Minute*. And the *Heat* of
*Black-Hellebore*, not till after four full *Minutes* from the first *Contact*.

5. §. The *Status*, or space wherein the *Taste* continues in its heighth,
is also divers. So the *Heat* of the *Seed-Case* of *Helleboraster*, comes to
its heighth, and begins to decline within half a *Minute*; that of the
*Root* of *Garden-Scurvygrass*, not till after a *Minute*; and that of the
*Root* of *Asarum*, not till after two full *Minutes*.

6 §. And *Lastly*, the *Declination*, or the space betwixt the first
*Remission* of the *Taste*, and its total *Extinction*. For instance, The *Leavs*
of *Millefolium*, are *Bitter* in the 4ᵗʰ *Degree*, and *Hot* only in the 1ˢᵗ
yet the *Heat* continues for sometime, and the *Bitter* presently vanishes.
*Calamus Aromaticus*, is *Bitter* in the 4ᵗʰ *Degree*, *Hot* in the 1ˢᵗ, and *Aromatick*
in the 3ᵈ: yet the *Bitter* quickly vanishes, the *Heat* continues
two *Minutes*, and the *Aromatick* seven or eight. The *Heat* of
the *Root* of *Contrayerra*, is extended, almost to two *Minutes*; the
*Pungency* of *Jalap*, almost to six; the *Heat* of *Garden Scurvygrass*, to
seven or eight. And even the *Bitterness* of *Wild Cucumer*, to near a
quarter of an hour. But the *Heat* of *Euphorbium* dureth much longer,
as also that of *Black Hellebore*, *sc.* above half an hour.

7. §. So that the *Augmentum*, is seldom extended beyond Four or
Six *Minutes*, from the first *Contact*: but the *Declination*, sometimes to
Thirty, Fourty, or more. Thus far of the *Terms* of *Tast*, or the manner
of their *Intension* and *Remission*.
