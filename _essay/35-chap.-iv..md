### CHAP. IV.

### Of the Parts and Texture of the Leaf.

![I](images/i_drop_i_153.jpg)

 COME next to observe the several *Parts*, whereof
the *Leaf* is composed: and first the *Skin*. This
being stript off the *Leaf*, although to the bare Eye
it looks no otherwise than a *Skin* of *Isinglass*: yet
being viewed through a good *Glass*, with a clear
and true Light, and in an advantagious Position; it
appears to consist not only of *Organical Parts*, as
do the *Skins* of *Animals*; but these also Regularly mixed together; that
is, of *Parenchymous* and *Lignous Fibres*, all very curiously interwoven
as it were, into a piece of admirably fine white *Sarcenet*: as in *Flag*,
*Tulip*, and the like. *Tab. 48.*

2. §. From hence, it is easy to conceive how the *Skins* of all
*Plants*, as well as those of *Animals*, are perspirable; *sc.* between the
several *Fibers* of which they consist. But as the *Skins* of *Animals*,
especially in some *Parts*, are made with certain open *Pores* or *Orifices*,
either for the Reception, or the Elimination of something for the benefit
of the *Body*: so likewise the *Skins*, of at least many *Plants*, are
formed with several *Orifices* or *Pass-ports*, either for the better *Avolation*
of *Superfluous Sap*, or the *Admission* of *Aer*.

3. §. THESE *Orifices* are not in all *Leaves* alike; but varied in
*Bigness*, *Number*, *Shape*, and *Position*: Serving to the different *Nature*
of the *Plant*, or *Leaf*; and giving the *Leaf*, as it were, a different *Grain*.
*Princes Feather*, *i. e.* a Sort of *Sanicle*, they stand only on the Edges
of the *Leaf*; but are very ample. In the *White Lily*, they are *Oval*,
very white, and each surrounded with a slender white *Border*. They
stand about a 6ᵗʰ or 8ᵗʰ part of an Inch distant, *Tab. 48.* as they appear through
a good *Glass*, all over the *Leaf*, but not in any regular Order. These
*Orifices* are the cause of the Greyish *Gloss* on the upper side the *Leaf*:
for the Back-side, in which there are none of them, is of a dark
*Sea-Green*.

4. §. In the *Leaf* of *Pine*, they are also *Oval*, and about the same
*Bigness* and *Number*, as in that of a *Lily*; yet without a Border. *Tab. 48.* But
their *Position* is very Elegant, standing all, most exactly, in *Rank* and
*File* from one end of the *Leaf* to the other.

5. §. NEXT TO the *Skin*, lies the *Pulpy* part of the *Leaf*; which
by the same latitude, as *Use* hath taught us in many other Words, I
call the *Parenchyma*. This *Parenchyma* or *Pulp* of the *Leaf*, like the
*Pith*, and all other *Parenchymous Parts* of a *Plant* is made up of incomparably
small *Cylindrick Fibres*: and these *Fibres*, in most *Leaves*,
woven and woun’d up into little *Bladders*.

6. §. The *Bladders* are here of several Sizes, as in the *Pith*: but
generally more visible in the *Stalk*, than in the *Body* of the *Leaf*. *Tab. 49.* Varied,
as in the *Pith*, so here, not according to the *Size*, but the *Nature*
of the *Leaf*. So in *Common Dock*, and *Moth Mullein*, both Great

*Leaves*, they are Small; in *Wild Clary*, a Lesser *Leaf*, they are very
Large. *Tab. 50.* In the *Body* of the *Leaf*, sometimes the *Sides* of the greater
*Bladders*, are made up of lesser ones; as in *Borage*.

7. §. In some *Leaves*, these *Parenchymous Fibres* are all drawn close
up together. In the Former, they are as the *Threds* in the *Open-work*
of *Bone-Lace*; in These, as the same *Threds*, in the *Cloth-work*.

8. §. The *Pithy Part*, in the *Stalk*, and almost up to the Top of
the chief *Fiber*, in many *Leaves*, is Tubular; even whilst they are yet
Young and Sappy: as in *Sweet Chervil*, *Hemlock*, *Endive*, *Cichory*,
*Lampsana*, *Dandelion*, *Burdock*, *Daisye*, *Scorzonera*, and others. And
sometimes the said *Pithy Part* is opened into several little *Pipes*, like so
many *Aer-Vessels*, above ⅓  of a Foot long; as in the *Common Dock* and the
*Little Spurge*, by some called *Wart-Wort*.

9. §. THE *Strings* of the *Leaf*, or those *Fibres* which are visible
to the bare Eye, are composed of *Vessels* of the Two General
Kinds, *sc*, for *Sap*, and for *Aer*. They are joyntly distributed throughout
the *Leaf*: Yet not so, as to run meerly parallel; as in *Animals*,
every *Artery* hath its *Vein*: but the *Aer-Vessels* are every where Inclosed,
or as it were *sheathed* in the *Sap-Vessels*.

10. §. THEIR *Position* is various and regular, not only in the
*Body* of the *Leaf*, as is above shewed; but likewise in the *Stalk*: of
which also I have given several Instances in the *First* **Book**. I shall
here note, and more particularly describe, One or Two more. In the
*Stalk* of a *Mallow-Leaf*, they stand in Six Oblong *Parcels* of equal Size,
and in a *Ring* near the Circuit. *Tab. 49.* Whereby the *Stalk* is stronger, the
Growth hereof, before and behind, more equal, and so the posture
of the *Leaf* more erect.

11. §. In *Dandelyon*, they stand in *Five Parcels*: of which the
Greater stands a little *behind* the Centre of the *Stalk*; figured into a
very small *Half-Moon* or *Semi-Tube*, whose *Diametre*, through a *Glass*,
is not above ⅛ᵗʰ of an Inch. The other Four, are extream small *Cylinders*.
Altogether make an *Angle*, twice as big as that of a V Consonant.
*Tab. 49.* Whereby, although the *Stalk* be strong enough to support the younger
*Leaves*; yet those which are grown longer, and so not only by their
*Bulk*, but their farther Extension from the Center of *Gravity*, are
become more weighty; commonly lie flat on the Ground.

12. §. In *Wild Clary*, they stand also in *Five Parcels*, the Greater
stands not *behind*, but *before* the *Center*; making an *Arch*, whose *Chord*
in a *Glass*, is above ½ an Inch long; and belongeth to a *Circle*, whose
*Diameter* is an Inch and half. *Tab. 49.* The other Four, are small *Cylinders*, also
different from those in *Dandelion*; the two bigger, there standing
hindmost; but here, the two Less, and the two Bigger, within the
two round *Ridges* of the *Stalk*.

13. §. From hence it is, that the *Leaves* of this *Plant* have not only
a *Prone* or *Horizontal Posture*, but also make that *Forceable Pressure* on
the Ground, which can by no means be imputed to their *Weight*. For
the *Great Arched-Fibre* standing before the *Centre* of the *Stalk*, and
the two Longer Round ones being uppermost, in the *Ridges* of the
*Stalk*; they put on the upper parts thereof to a more full and forward
Growth, and so to bow the *Leaf* back-ward. And the *Fibrous
Arch* being, though broad, yet almost flat, doth hereby the more easily
yield to that *Motion*.

14. §. In *Borage*, and *Moth-Mullen*, they stand also in *Five Parcels*. *Tab. 49.*
In the former, the largest maketh still a more bulky *Arch*, than
that of *Clary*; being thicker, as broad, and of a lesser *Circle* or more
bowed. But in *Mullein*, it maketh almost an entire Oval.

15. §. By means of this *Figuration*, a sufficient number of *Vessels*
for such large *Leaves*, are not only more conveniently Distributed into
them; but also stand more safely in the *Stalk*. For were the *Arch* contracted
into a *solid Cylinder*, it could not so presently be resolved into
small *Fibers*. And were it laid into a flat *Plate*, or straight out, either
the *Figure* of the *Stalk*, and so of the *Leaf*, must be altered; or else, the
two ends of the *Plate*, would come too near the Circumference of the
*Stalk*, and so be more liable to the *Impressions* of the *Weather*: as may
be observed in cutting the *Stalk* transversly, and by the *Figures*.

16. §. IN the *Body* of the *Leaf*, besides the *Positions* of the *Fibrous
Strings* or *Threds*; above expressed, there is one *Thred*, bigger or less,
which in all *Plants*, runs round the Edge of the *Leaf*, and hems in all the
rest; but can hardly be well observed in any, without stripping off the
*Skin* of the *Leaf*. *Tab. 50.* When the *Fibres* of the *Leaf*, are bigger, or less tender,
as in *Holly*, the *Skin* and the *Pulp* are sometimes found either rotted
off, or eaten away with *Insects*; whereby, both the said surrounding
*Fiber*, and the rest, are all very fairly visible.

17. §. THE *Vessels* seem to be continu’d, in the *Leaf*, by being
Ramified out of Greater into Less, as *Veins* or *Arteries* are in *Animals*.
But if the *Skin* and *Pulp* of the *Leaf*, as suppose a *Borage-Leaf* be taken
off, and the *Vessels* laid bare; by the help of a good *Glass*, it will appear;
That they are all of the same Size, every where in the *Leaf*; *Tab. 50.*
and also continued throughout the same, all several and distinct *Pipes* one
from another, as the *Threds* in a *Skein* of *Silk*. And that therefore the
*Distribution* of the *Threds* which the *Vessels* compose, is not the Ramifying
of Greater *Pipes* into Less; but the dividing a greater Cluster of
*Pipes*, into several lesser Clusters, till at last they come to be single; as
in the *Distribution* of the *Nerves*.

18. §. The *Vessels* seem also to be Inosculated, not only side to
side, but the ends of some into the Sides of others. But neither is
this ever really done: *Tab. 50.* the lesser *Threds*, being only so far diducted, as
sometimes to stand at *Right-Angles* with the greater. So that they are
Inosculated only End to End or Mouth to Mouth, after they are come
at last to their final distribution.

19. §. The *Aer-Vessels*, are not only, as is said, Existent in the
*Leaves* of all *Plants*; but are herein also discoverable without the help
of *Glasses*: For upon breaking the *Stalk* or chief *Fibers* of a *Leaf*; the
likeness of a fine *Woolly* Substance, or rather of curious small *Cobwebs*,
may be seen to hang at both the broken Ends. This is taken notice of,
only in some few *Plants*, as in *Scabious*, where it is more visible.
 *Tab. 51, & 52.* But
may also be seen more or less, in most other *Plants*, if the *Leaves* be very
tenderly broken: as I have noted near twenty years since; and
thence conjectur’d them a Sort of *Vessel* common to *Plants*. Now this
fine *Wool*, is really a *Skein* of *Aer-Vessels*, or rather of the *Fibers* of the
*Aer-Vessels*, unroaved from their *Spiral Position*, and so drawn out in
Length. As they appear thus unroaved and drawn out at Length, both
to the bare Eye, and through a good *Microscope*, I have represented in
two Examples, the one a *Scabious Leaf*, the other that of a *Vine*.

20. §. THE *Weftage* of the *Strings* and *Parenchymous Fibers* together,
is here made in the same manner, as hath been described in the
*Anatomy* of the *Root*, and *Trunk*: the former being in some Sort as the
*Warp*, the latter as the *Woof* of the *Leaf*.

21. §. And one Example we have (it may be more than one)
wherein Nature shews, though not a greater, yet a different *Art*; and
that is the *Palm-Net*. For whereas in other *Plants*, the *Webb* is made
betwixt the *Lignous-Strings* and the *Fibers* of the *Parenchyma*, only visible
through a *Microscope*: here the said *Strings* themselves are Interwoven,
and the *Weftage* apparent to the bare Eye. Of these *Palm-Nets*
or *Sacks*, there are several Sorts. One of them is composed in this
manner. It hath a Fivefold *Series* of *Lignous Strings* or *Fibers*. The
greatest whereof swell out above the rest; and like so many *Ribs*, are
obliquely produced on both hands, so as to encompass the *Sack*. Along
each of these *Ribs*, on the inside the *Sack*, runs a small *Whitish Line*;
being a *Thread* of *Aer-Vessels* growing thereto. Betwixt these *Ribs* or
larger *Strings*, there are others much less, Two or Three betwixt *Rib*
and *Rib*, *Parallelly* interjected. On the inside, there is a Third *Series*,
which is also obliquely produced; but transversly to the former. The
Fourth and Fifth, consist of the smallest *Strings*; not only Transversly
produced, but also Alternately, from the outside to the inside of the
*Sack*, *& vice versa*. By these two last, all the rest are most elaborately
woven into one entire and strong piece of Work.
