### CHAP. III.

### Of the SUBJECT or SEAT of Tasts.

![T](images/i_drop_t_284.jpg)
HE
 *Third* and *Last* way of distinguishing *Tasts*, is
by their *Subject*, or the *Part* or *Parts* where they
are either wholly or chiefly perceived. And so,
*Tasts* are either *Fixed*, or *Movable*.

2. §. A *Fixed Tast*, is that which keepeth
within the compass of some one *Part*, all the time
of its *Duration*; as upon the *Tip*, or the *Root* of
the *Tongue*, or other *Part*.

3. §. A *Movable Taste*, is either *Diffusive* or *Transitive*.

4. §. A *Diffusive Taste*, I call that, which by degrees spreads
abroad into divers *Parts*, and yet in the mean time, adheres to that
*Part* in which it is first perceived. So the *Bitterness* in the dryed *Roots*
of *Black Hellebore*, is first felt on the *Tip* of the *Tongue*; from whence
it spreads it self to the midle of the same. And the *Bitterness* of the
*Leavs* of *Wild Cucumer*, spreads from the *Tip*, to the *Root* of the
*Tongue*.

5. §. A *Transitive Taste*, is that, which after sometime, wholly
quitting the *Part* wherein it is first perceived, is thence transfered into
some other *Part*: as the *Bitterness* of *Gentian*, imediately from the *Tip*,
to the midle of the *Tongue*. And most of the *Diffusive*, are also *Transitive*.

6. §. The several *Parts* which these ways become, and with some
latitude may be called, the *Seats* of *Tasts*, are, the *Lips*, *Tongue*, *Palate*,
*Throat* and *Gulet*.

7. §. Upon the *Lips*, the *Root* of white *Hellebore*, as also of *Pyrethrum*,
being chewed, make a sensible *Impression*; which continues
(like the flame of a *Coal* betwixt in and out) for 9 or 10 *Minutes*.
But the *Heat* in other *Parts* much longer.

8. §. Upon the *Tongue*, *Tasts* are perceived in Three places, as
hath been intimated. On the *Tip* or *Cone* of the *Tongue*; as most commonly.
On or near the *Basis* of the *Tongue*; where the *Taste* of the
*Leavs* of *Wild Cucumer* chiefly fixeth it self. Or on the *Vertex* or midle
of the *Tongue*; in which place it is observable, that the *Tast* of *Gentian*,
*Colocynthis*, and divers other *Bodies*, is then considerably strong,
when not at all perceived at the *Tip* of the *Tongue* or in any other *Part*.

9. §. Upon the *Palate* or *Roofe* of the *Mouth*, the *Root*, as I take
it, of *Deadly Nightshade* maketh its chief *Impression*; and there continues
about four *Minutes* in some degree.

10. §. The *Throat*, or the *Uvula*, *Larinx* and other adjacent *Parts*
are oftentimes the *Seat* of *Taste*. For there are many *Bodies*, which
although they have scarce any *Taste* upon the *Tongue*, or any other of
the aforesaid *Parts*, yet make a strong *Impression* on the *Throat*: as the
*Leavs* of little *Daisy*, little *Celandine*, and of *Pimpinel*; as also the
*Roots* of *Jalap*, *Mercury*, *Asparagus* and others. Which being chewed
make little or no *Impression* on the *Tongue*, but their *Juyce* being swallowed,

causeth a kind of pricking in the *Throat*; as when one is provoked
by a sharp *Rheum*.

11. §. And that this *Taste* or *Sense*, is truly distinct from either
the *Heat*, *Pungency*, or *Acritude* upon the *Tongue*, it is hence further
manifest; In that *Pyrethrum*, which is very *Hot*, and *Cortex Winteranus*
which is very *Pungent* upon the *Tongue*; yet their *Juyce* being swallowed,
causeth no *Heat*, *Pungency* or *Exasperation* in the *Throat*.

12. §. *Lastly*, if we will take the word (*Tast*) in a larger sense,
the *Oesophagus* it self may be said to be sometimes the *Subject* thereof;
as of the *Heat* produced by the *Root* of *Common Wormwood*. For of
this *Heat* it is remarquable, that being first perceived on the *Tip* of the
*Tongue*, it thence maketh its *transit* to the *Root* of the *Tongue*, and so
into the *Throat*, and by degrees descends into the very *Gulet*; where
it seemeth to warm the *Stomach*; and so continues, in some degree,
almost ¼ of an hour. And the *Transition* and *Descent* of this *Heat* is
made, although none of the *Juyce* be swallowed. And in this maner
*Tasts* are distinguished with respect to their *Subject*.

13. §. So that the general *Diversities* of *Tasts* are these. With
respect to their *Species*, they are *Simplices vel Compositi*; To their *Degree*,
*Remissi vel Intensi*; To their *Duration*, *Breves vel Diuturni*;
To the *Terms* of their *Motion*, *Celeres vel Tardi*; and lastly, To their
*Subject*, *Fixi, Diffusivi & Transitivi*.

14. §. I HAVE thus endeavoured to draw up a *Scheme* or *Inventory*
of the several sorts of *Tasts*. In which, some may think, that I have
over done: and that as *Galen* hath been censured for being too curious
in the *Distinctions* of *Pulses*; so have I been, in these of *Tasts*.
Not to enquire now, how far the *Differences* of the *Pulse* may be extended,
or be fit to be taken notice of; I shall only say, That we have
not so much reason to censure him, if he hath given us some few which
are coincident; as we have to thank him, for observing so many which
are really distinct.

15. §. By the *Scheme* of *Tasts* here represented, we may be able,
so to enumerate the *Modes* of any *Tast*, as to make a *Scientifick Definition*
of it. Which is pleasant *Instruction* to any inquisitive mind; these
things being all matter of sense and demonstration; wherein lyeth,
though not always the most plausible, yet the most satisfying *Philosophy*;
and where men, after they are grown weary with turning round,
are oftentimes contented to rest.

16. §. But the usefulness of this *Schem* will further appear, in two
respects; *sc.* In conducting us to a cleerer and more particular *Explication*
of the *Causes* of *Tasts*: and the *Investigation* of the *Virtues* of those
*Bodies* in which they reside. Whereof in the following *Chapters*.
