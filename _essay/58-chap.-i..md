### CHAP. I.

### Of the FIGURES of Seeds.

![T](images/i_drop_t_148.jpg)
HE
*Figures* of *Seeds*, or rather of their outward
*Covers*, are made suitable, Partly to their
*Collocation* in the *Uterus*, as the *End*. So those
of *Mallow*, standing like a Coronet round the
*Stalk*, are of a wedged *Figure*; whereby their
sharp Edges do all meet together in one *Centre*.
Partly, to the various distribution of the *Vessels*
or *Fibers*, as one *Cause*: by which the *Measures*
and *Surface* of *Seeds*, as well as of the *Leaves*
of *Plants*, are diversified. And partly, to the Nature of the *Saline*
and other *Principles* regent in a *Plant*, as another principal *Cause*.
And therefore the more *stony*, *brittle*, or full of *Salt* the *Covers* of any
*Seeds* are, they are generally more *angular*, and their *Figure*, whether
*angular* or not, more constantly observed. So the *Tartareous Stone* of
a *Plum*, is not only more *angular*, but also more regular than the Husk
of the Kernel of a *Pear* or *Apple*.

2. §. For all Stones are measured by several *Circles*, whose *Diametres*
hold a certain proportion to the Length of the *Stone*; in the
same manner as hath been shewed in the description of the *Leaf*.
 *P. 1. Ch. 3.* So
the *Stone* of the *Pease-Cod-Plum*, is measured by two *Circles*. That of
the *Turkey-Plum* with Four. *Tab. 72.* That of the *Aprecok-Plum*, with Two
repeated oppositely; being perfectly *Rhomboid*. To which, those
also of the *Wheat-Plum*, *Damasceen*, and some others, allude. And some
are measured by four *Circles*, and one repeated.

3. §. The *Figures*, not only of the larger sort of *Seeds*, but even
of the smallest, have much and elegant variety. We will take the
pleasure of comparing these which follow.

4. §. And first of all, some are perfectly *Spherick*, and with an even
*Surface*; *Tab. 73.* as that of little *Century*. That of *Spergula* is also *Spherick*;
but hath a knobed *Surface*, and is encompassed with a *Membraneous
Rimm*, like the *Horizon* of a Globe. That of little *Celandine* is Circular,
but compressed like a *Cheese*.

5. §. Others are *Nephroideous*, or as it were *Hemispherick*. Of which
*Figure*, and hereunto approaching, there are a greater number than
of any other; as that which agrees with the more frequent *Shape* and
*Fold* of the *Lobes* and *Radicle* of the *Seed*, as shall be seen. Yet with
some difference, as to their *Shape* and *Surface*. So, that of *Lychnis Sylvestris*
is figur’d just like the kidney of a *Cat*; and hath a knobed *Surface*.
*Tab. 73.* That of *Poppey* comes near it in *Shape*; but hath a *Surface* exactly
like that part of the *Paunch* of a *Sheep*, called the *Hony-Coome*.
That of great *Celandine*, is a little more oblong; and so, like the
Kidney, not of a *Cat*, but of a *Sheep*: chequered with parallel *Rings*
and other short *Lines* placed alternately betwixt them.

6. §. Where, by the way, we may see, as well by the *Seed*, as by
the other *Parts*, of how different kinds, the Great and Little *Celandine*,
notwithstanding their Names, are to be esteemed.

7. §. The *Seed* also of *Ben* or *spatling Poppey* is somewhat like a
*Kidney*: *Tab. 73.* but hath its Circumference raised up into a double *Ridge*: to
which several small *Ridges* do in some sort also radiate from one *Centre*
*sc.* the *Base* of the *Seed*.

*Tab. 73.*
8. §. The *Seed* of *Chickweed*, is partly like a *Kidney*, and partly
like a little *Retort*. As also that of *Pentaphyl. fragiferum*. But the former
is rough cast with small pieces having as it were feet on each side,
like little *Insects*. With which, the *Seed* of *Leuchanthemum* (which
may be called, the *Giant-Chickweed*) doth much agree. The latter,
hath several *Fibrous Ridges*, resembling the *Fibres* in the *Auricles* of
the *Heart*; or running from the nose to the Circumference, somewhat
like the *Azymuth Lines* on a *Quadrant*.

*Tab. 73.*
9. §. Some are *Oval*; as that of the little *Bell*, and rough cast
with *Fibres* almost parallel and produced by the Length of the *Seed*.
In which latter respect, the *Seeds* also of *Trachelium* and some other like
*Plants*, are agreeable. That of *Brooklime*, is also *Oval*, but encompassed
with a thick *Rimm*, narrowing all the way to the *Base* of the *Seed*.

10. §. The *Seed* of *Dovesfoot* hath an *oval Cone*, and a flat *Base*.
Its *Surface* favous, like that of *Poppy*, *Toad-flax*, and some other *Seeds*.
*Tab. 73.* That of *Sedum minus æstivum luteum*, is in a manner the *Figure* of
the former inverted, being flat, not at the *Base*, but on the *Top*. And
whereas that rises with a blunt *Angle*, this hath only a *Ridg*, raised
above the *Surface* of the *Seed*.

11. §. The *Seeds* of divers sorts of *Grass*, are more *Conick*, as particularly
of that, which for the likeness its *Seed* hath to a *Barly Corn*,
may be called *Barley-Grass*. And I little doubt, but that among the
several sorts of *Grass*, *Tab. 73.* there are some which answer to all the kinds of
*Esculent Grains*, as *Oat-Grass*, *Rice-Grass*, *Wheat-Grass*, *Rye-Grass*.
And accordingly, that they may be more profitably sown in one Ground,
than in another; and used with distinction, for the higher, or more

wholsome feeding of Cattle. A *Rush*, though it seems an imperfect
*Plant*, yet besides its *Flower*, hath also a plentiful brood of *Seeds* of a
*Conick Figure*.

12. §. Some *Seeds* are *Cylindrick*, as that of St. *Johns-wort*, as
also of *Tutsan*, and some other like *Plants*, with some little diversity in
the *Shape* or *Surface* of the *Seed*. *Tab. 73.* That of *Vervain*, is in a manner,
half a *Cylinder*: the true *Seed* lying in the *Covers*, like a Child, in a
Cradle without an head.

13. §. Others are rather *Conico-Cylindrick*, as that of *Jacobæa*;
*Tab. 73.* having a Coronet on the top, and several furrows by the Length round
about. Answerable to which, is that of *Erygerum*; in *Shape* not
unlike to a *Rowling-pin*.

14. §. Some are *Plani-Conick*, as that of *Nettle*, which is shaped
somewhat like the end of a *Speer*. That of *Eye-bright* is more *Eliptick*;
with several *Ridges* running by the Length; and joyned together with
short pieces transversly, as in the looping of *Lace*. *Tab. 74.* That of *Wormwood*
not very unlike a little flat *Essence-Glass*: in which, the *Fibres*
are produced by the Length, as the *Ridges* are in *Eye-bright*. And so in
*Yarrow*, which is also encompassed with a *Membraneous Rimm*. That
of *Dandelyon*, is *Plani-Conick* towards the *Base*. And so those of *Lettice*,
*Sonchus*, and some others. To which, those also of *Hieraceum*, *Tragopogon*,
*Scorzonera*, &c. with respect to their *Surface*, do all allude.

15. §. And some are *Conico-Triangular*. Of which, that of *Sorrel*
is *Conick* at both ends; the sides equal; and upon every *Angle*,
hath a narrow and sharp *Rimm*. As also that of *Anagallis*; but the
*Sides* are *Spheri-conick*, and so the ends are blunt. *Tab. 74.* They are also
pounced with many little round *Cavities*. But have no *Rimm* upon
the *Angles*.

16. §. The *Seed* of *Nigella* is *Triangular*, and *Conick* only at the
*Top*. On every *Angle*, hath a narrow *Rimm*; the three *Sides* equal,
and *Spheri-conick*; surrounded with seven or eight *Ridges* by the girth,
joyned together in some places with others transversly. *Tab. 74.* That of *Arsmart*,
is also *Triangular* and *Conick* at the *Top*. But one of the *Sides*
is almost equal to the other two; which stand low. That of *Knot-Grass*
hath three *Sides*, one less than another; being as 5, 3, and 2,
or thereabout.

17. §. The next (which I take to be the *Seed* of a sort of *Bugloss*)
is very oddly *figured*. The *Base*, *oval*; the *Top*, *conick*; the
*Back*, swelling and round as an *Egg*; *Tab. 74.* the *Belly* also swelling, but rising
up into an obtuse *Angle* highest in the midle, somewhat like a *Breastpiece*
of *Armour*: and is encompassed with a *Rimm* sloaped upward.

18. §. That of *Moldavian Bawm*, is *Triangular*, and *Conick* only
at the *Base*. The place where it is fastned, shaped like the Beard of
a Dart. Two of the *Sides* are *Plani-conick*, the Third *Spheri-conick*, *Tab. 74.*
and near as big as both the other two. The *Head* flat, with a *Rimm*
erected upon each *Side*, so as to make a *Spherical Triangle*. Approaching
to this, are those of *Sage*, *Horehound*, *Clary*, &c.

19. §. That also of *Bellis Tanaceti folio*, hath two *Sides Planiconick*,
and a third *Sphericonick*. *Tab. 74.* The two first have several *Ridges* running
to the *Base*. Which is not perfectly *conick*, but a little dilated
into two obtuse *Angles*. The *Head Triangular*, with one *Side* convex,

the other Two straight, a little hollowd, and having a small pinacle
in the *Center*.

20. §. That of *Stæchas Arabica*, as the former, saving, that the
*Head* is *oval*, and the *Base* sloaped into a little *Triangle*. That of
*Wartwort* or *Sun-Spurge*, hath a very complex *Figure*. The *Belly* consisteth
of two *Planiconick* Sides, as the former; the Back, *Sphericonick*.
*Tab. 74.* The whole *Seed*, in a manner, *Conick-oval*. Yet the *Base* and *Head*
both flat. In the midle of the former, a Peg by which the *Seed* is
fastned; and of the latter, a poynted *Knob*. The midle of the *Belly-Sides*,
hollowed, so as to make a flat *Rimm* of equal *Bredth*; and the
hollows filled up with *Bladders* like those in all the *Parenchymus Parts*
of a *Plant*.

21. §. Lastly, there are some *Seeds* which are square. Whereof
some are straight, as that of *Fox-glove*; *Tab. 74.* which hath also an even *Surface*:
And that of *Blattaria*, in which there are several little hollows
in even Rows. And so in *Brounwort*.

22. §. And some *Convex*, as that of *Chrysanthemum Americ*. ’Tis
*Quadrati-conick*, or square and sharp at the *Base*, and big at the
*Head*. *Tab. 74.* The *Sides* all plain; and a thin *Rimm* erected upon every *Angle*.
As also on the four *Sides* of the *Head*, which is flat, with a little
*Pinacle* in the midle.

23. §. The *Seed* also of *Tansey*, is a *Conick* and bended square not
with the *Angle* forward, as the former, but the *Side*. *Tab. 74.* And in the
place of every *Rimm*, hath a round *Ridge*. Somewhat like to this, are
those of *Febrifuga*, *Mayweed*, and some others. Thus far of the *Figures*
of *Seeds*.
