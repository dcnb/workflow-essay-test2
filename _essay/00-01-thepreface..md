PREFACE.

T
is a *Politick* or *Civil Virtue* in every
prudent mans Eye, To set himself an
example, in what he doth, unto others.
And in so doing, he looks upon himself
as accountable, in some sort, to all
Men. To those therefore, who may
either expresly, or tacitly, expect the Reasons, upon
which I first undertook the *Anatomy* of *Plants*, and also
made the after-progress therein; I shall summe them
up as follows.

The first occasion of directing my Thoughts this
way, was in the *Year 1664*, upon reading some, of
the many and curious Inventions of Learned Men, in
the *Bodies* of *Animals*. For considering, that both
of them came at first out of the same *Hand*; and
were therefore the *Contrivances* of the same *Wisdom*:
I thence fully assured my self, that it could not be a
vain Design; to seek it in both. And being then newly
furnished with a good stock of *Seeds*, in order to
raise a *Nursery* of *Plants*; I resolved, besides what I
first aimed at, to make the utmost use of them for
that purpose: that so I might put somewhat upon that
side the *Leaf* which the best *Botanicks* had left bare
and empty. And in which, notwithstanding some other
Learned Men had inferred somewhat of this nature;
as Dr. *Highmore* in his *Book* of *Generation*, Dr.
*Sharrock* of the *Propagation* of *Plants*, and Mr. *Hook*
in his *Micrography*: yet but collaterally, and whithout
shewing any purpose of managing this *Part* of *Natural
History*. And although it seemed at first an Objection
in my way, That the first projectors seldome
bring their business to any good end: yet I also knew,
That if Men should stay for an Example in every thing;
nothing extraordinary would ever be done.

But notwithstanding the reasonableness of the Design;
yet I did not forget, that, in respect of the
Undertaker, there might be *Impar congressus*. And therefore,
before I had ventured very far, in the Year 1668,
I imparted it to my Brother-in-Law, the Learned Dr.
*Henry Sampson*, now *Fellow* of the *Colledge* of *Physicians*
in *London*. Who not only very well liked the
same; but also excited me to a vigorous and accurate
prosecution of it. Which he did, partly, by mentioning
a very pertinent passage of Dr. *Glisson*, in the *Preface* to
his *Book de Hepate*,⁠[1] which I had not then read.

*Plantæ quoque in hunc censum* (sc. Anatomicum) *veniunt;
variâ enim Partium texturâ, & differentiis constant: & proculdubio,
ex acurata earundem dissectione, utiles valde observationes
nobis exurgerent: præstaretque in illis (inferioris
licet ordinis) rebus examinandis operam impendere, quam in
transcribendis ut sæpe sit, aliorum laboribus, inutiliter ætatem
transigere. Quippe hoc pacto, ignavarum apum more, aliena
duntaxat alvearia expilamus, nihilque bono publico adjicimus.*

[1] Ch. 1.

After I had finished the *First Book*, that I might know
the sense also of other Learned Men, whether the steps
I had already taken, would warrant me to proceed any
further: I put some part of it into the same Hand;
who, in the Year 1670, communicated the same to
Mr. *Oldenburge*, then *Secretary* to the *Royal Society*:
and after he had read it over, it was, upon his motion, delivered
to that excellent Person Dr. *John Wilkins* then
*Bishop* of *Chester*; who produced it at a Meeting of the
*Royal Society*, and desired, they might see the rest. Which,
or the greatest part, being also presented to them, the Right
Honourable the Lord Vicount *Brouncker*, then *President*
of the *Royal Society*, was pleased to peruse the same.
Presently, after which, at a Meeting of the Council

of the said *Society*, the following *Order* was made,
and entred in their Council-Book with this Date, and
in these words:

*May 11ᵗʰ 1671.*

*Then was Licensed Dr.* Nehemjah Grew’*s
Book, Entituled,* The Anatomy of Vegetables
*begun; together with an account of* Vegetation
*grounded thereupon. And Ordered to be
Printed by the Printer to the* Royal Society.

Hereupon, I was obliged to send the Book to the
Press. And upon the 9ᵗʰ of *November* following in
the same Year 1671, when it was near being printed,
my Lord *Brouncher* signed the forementioned *Order*: the
Printer, whose Name was to be inserted therein, not
having received his *Diploma* till that time.

The Book being quickly after printed off; I ordered
it to be Presented to the *Royal Society*; which
was accordingly done at one of their Meetings *December
7, 1671*. And also to be sent to the Bishop of
*Chester*; who was pleased to signifie his acceptance thereof
by a Letter dated at *Chester*, *December* 26ᵗʰ 1671.
now filed amongst others in the Custody of the *Royal
Society*: part whereof, in regard it relates to matter of
Fact, I shall here recite.

Sir,

*I did yesterday receive your Book; and am very
sensible of the Honour you have done me in the Dedication
of it. You was very happy in the choice

of this Subject to write upon; one of the most Noble
and the most Copious parts of* Philosophy; *and
such an one, as hath hitherto lain uncultivated. And
you have been very successful in your first Attempt
about it, in so many remarkable Observations and
Discoveries, as you have made already. I could
heartily wish, that you would still apply your self
to this kind of Enquiries. You will find that Additionals
will come in more copiously and easily. And
it is not fit, that any one should, by his Superstructions,
carry away the praise from him, who was
the first Inventor, and who laid the Foundations,
wherein the greatest difficulty doth consist, &c.*

Having thus submitted my self to the Judgment of
many Learned Men; I saw that my Journey must not
here end. So that, like one who is got into a Wood, I
thought I might as fairly find my way out, by going
on, as by making a retreat. Whereupon, I began to
draw up a *Scheme* of the whole *Design*.

While I was doing this, I received news from *London*,
that the same day, *December 7. 1671*, in which
my Book, then printed, was presented to the *Royal Society*:
there was also presented a *Manuscript* (without
*Figures*) from Seignior *Malpighi*, upon the same
Subject; dated at *Bononia*, *November,* 1ˢᵗ 1671. the
same, which Mr. *Oldenburge*, when it came to be printed,
calleth his *Idea*. And of this, entry was made in
their Journal Book. So that the *Royal Society* having now
a Prospect of the good service of an Ancient *Member*,
and one, who had highly merited by his Works then
extant; from thence forward, I looked upon my self to
be excused.

But soon after, receiving another Letter from the
Bishop of *Chester*, dated at *London*, *Febr. 18. 1672*. I

found the matter otherwise; and that the *Society* were
pleased to engage me to proceed. Whereof entry was
made by the *Secretary* in their Journal Book, at one
of their Meetings, *April, 18. 1672*, in these words:

*The* Society *was made acquainted with one
particular lately passed in the Council;* sc. *That
the Bishop of* Chester *had there proposed Dr.*
Grew *to be a Curator to the* Royal Society
*for the* Anatomy *of* Plants: *and that the
Council had approved of that* Proposal. *Upon
which, it was Ordered, That the Thanks of
the* Society *be returned to the Lord Bishop of*
Chester, *for this* Proposal, *and to the Council
for their Approbation of the same.*

This they might be induced to do; upon considering,
that it would be no disadvantage to the credit of those
matters, which were so new and strange, to be offered
to the World from a double Authority. For one, although
he may have no mind to deceive; yet is it more
likely for one, than for two, to be deceived. Likewise,
that the same Subject, being prosecuted by two Hands,
would be the more illustrated by the different Examples
produced by both. And that, as in other matters, so
here, the defects of both, would mutually be supplyed.

Whether for these, or other Reasons also, they were
pleased to pass the forementioned *Order*; that being
done, it had been very ill manners in me, not to have
answered their expectation therein. And therefore reassuming
the Design I had laid by, and having reduced
it to some intelligible *Idea*, it was submitted to the Censure
of the *Royal Society*: and it was thereupon ordered
it should be printed.

Not long after, I received a Curious and Learned
Book from Mons. *Dodart*, *Archiater* to the Prince of
*Conde*, and *Fellow* of the *Royal Academy* at *Paris*; in persuance
of whose Order, it was by him composed and
published. Which being a Design of a like Import,
I was glad to see it so far justify’d by that Illustrious *Society*,
as well as by our own.

In this *Idea*, one principal Thing I insist upon, for
a *Philosophical History* of *Plants*, is *Anatomy*. And, agreeing
to the *Method* therein proposed, all the Observations
conteined in the *First Book*, except one or two, were made
with the *Naked Eye*. To the end, I might first give a
proof, How far it was possible for us to go, without the
help of *Glasses*: which many Ingenious Men want;
and more, the patience to manage them. For the Truth
of these Observations, Seignior *Malpighi*, having procured
my Book to be translated into Latin for his
private use, speaks his own sense, in some of his Letters
to Mr. *Oldenburge*, printed at the end of his *Anatomy* of
*Plants*. And some of them, have since been confirmed,
both by our Learned Country-men Dr. *Wallis*, and
Mr. *Lister*; and by the Ingenious Mr. *Lewenhoeck*, abroad.

Having thus begun with the bare Eye; I next proceeded
to the use of the *Microscope*. And the Observations
thereby made, first on *Roots*, and afterwards on *Trunks*
and *Branches*, together with the *Figures*, were all exhibited
to the *Royal Society* at several times from *May 15.
1672.* to *April 2. 1674*; being the *Materials* for the *Second*
and *Third Parts*: and hereof *Memorials* were inserted
in their Journal Books.

After this, the *Royal Society* received from Seignior
*Malpighi* his *Second Part* of the *Anatomy* of *Plants*, together
with the *Figures* therein described, and his *Letters* to
their *Secretary*, dated at *Bononia* *Aug. 20ᵗʰ* of the same year
1674. when, and not before, he gave leave that the two
said *Parts* should be printed.

So soon as I had finished the *Second* and *Third Parts*, I
proceeded to the *Last*, *sc.* of *Leaves*, *Flowers*, *Fruits* and
*Seeds*: and those Things I met with, more remarquable,
were presented to the said *Society* in the Years 1676
& 1677. And the publishing of the former *Parts* successively,
as well as of all together, hath been done in
pursuance of their several *Orders* for the same.

Having concluded the *History* of *Perfect Plants*; I intended
to have subjoyned the *Description* of those which
are *Imperfect*. As also of *Parasitical*, *Marine*, and *Sensitive
Plants*. And lastly, a view of the chief Particulars,
wherein the *Mechanisme* of a *Plant*, is different from
that of an *Animal*. But these things I leave to some
other Hand.

The *First Book*, a little after it came forth; was
translated into the French *Tongue*, by Mons. Le *Vasseur*
an Ingenious Gentleman in *Paris*; elegantly, and in the
Judgment of those who are well skilled in that *Language*,
with much exactness, as to the sense. He having
taken special care, to have all the difficulties of
our own, by Me, cleared to him. And in a late Book
Entituled, *Philosophia vetus & nova* printed at *Noriberg*
1682. the Learned Author seems to have made use of this
Translation, for all that he hath taken notice of in that
my *First Book*.

By the Ingenious Collectors of the *German Ephemerides*,
both my *First*, *Second*, and *Third Books*, are all
published in *Latine*. But their unskilful Interpreter doth
often fail of the *Grammatical Sense*. Whose Errors, many
of them very gross, I desire may be imputed neither
to them, nor to my self.

Besides these, the *Second Lecture* of *Mixture* is also
translated into *French*, by Mons. *Mesmin* a Learned
Physician in *Paris*: whose *Version* is very well approved
by those who are competent Judges hereof.

This, and the rest which follow, are placed, not in the
order of *Time*; but more according to their Nature or
Relation one to another. All of them intended as a
Commentary upon some particulars mentioned, either
in the *First Lecture*, or in the *Idea*.

In the *Plates*, for the clearer conception of the *Part*
described, I have represented it, generally, as entire, as its
being magnified to some good degree, would bear.
So, for instance, not the *Barque*, *Wood*, or *Pith* of a *Root*
or *Tree*, by it self; but at least, some portion of all three
together: Whereby, both their *Texture*, and also their
Relation one to another, and the *Fabrick* of the whole,
may be observed at one *View*. Yet have I not every
where magnify’d the *Part* to the same degree; but more
or less, as was necessary to represent what is spoken of it.
And very highly, only in some few Examples, as in
*Tab. 40.* which may suffice to illustrate the rest. Some of
the *Plates*, especially those which I did not draw to the
*Engravers* hand, are a little hard and stiff: but they are all
well enough done, to represent what they intend.
