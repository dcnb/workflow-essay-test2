N
 discourse upon a *Lecture* formerly read, concerning
the *Lixivial Salts* of *Plants*; It was mentioned, as a
thing asserted by some *Phylosophers*, That *Water*
having been fully impregnated with one kind of
*Salt*, so as to bear no more of that kind; it would
yet bear, or dissolve some portion of another; and
so of a third. And it was referred to Me by this
Honourable Chair, to examine and produce the *Experiment*. The doing
whereof brought into my mind divers other *Experiments* hereunto relating.

2. §. As next, With what difference of quantity this *Superimpregnation*
would be made, upon the *Solution* of different *Salts*?

3. §. *Thirdly*, Whether the *Solution* of a smaller quantity of several
*Salts*, doth consist with the *non-increase* of the bulk of the *Water*?
Because this also is affirmed by some.

4. §. *Fourthly*, What quantity of the several kinds of *Salt*, may
be dissolved severally, in the same quantity of *Water*?

5. §. *Fifthly*, Whether by dissolving a *Salt* in *Water*, there be any
*Space* gained, or not? That is, whether the *Bulk* of the *Water* be
greater, before the *Salt* lying in it be fully dissolved, than it is afterwards?
Or if a *Cubick Inch* of *Salt* be dissolved in nine *Cubick Inches*
of *Water*; Whether the *Water* will then fill a *Vessel* of ten *Cubick Inches
content*?

6. §. *Sixthly*, Whether the *Space* be equally gained, by an equal
encrease of the same *Salt*?

7. §. *Seventhly*, Whether upon the *Solution* of several kinds of
*Salts*, be gained so many several quantities of *Space*? That is, if the
*Solution* of common *Salt* gains, suppose, an *Inch*, whether the *Solution* of
*Salt Armoniack* gains as much, or more, or less? and so for other *Salts*.

8. §. *Eighthly*, What that just space may be, which any *Salt* gaineth
with respect to its own *Bulk*, or that of the *Water*?

9. §. And first, for the *Superimpregnation* of *Water*; I put into
a bottle ℥ij of fair *Water*; adding thereto, first half an Ounce of *Nitre*;
and afterwards more, as the *Water* would dissolve it; and (that
I might be sure the *Impregnation* was full) some portion above what
the *Water* would bear. Then having separated this remaining portion;
I put to this *Solution* of *Nitre*, two Drachms of *Sal Armoniac*; which
wholly and easily dissolved in the said *Solution*; though it would not
bear a grain more of *Nitre*. I then added a third Drachm of *Sal Armoniac*,
after that a fourth, and a fifth; all which, within the space
of half an hour, were perfectly dissolved in the said *Solution*, without
any precipitation of the *Nitre*.

10. §. In the making of this Experiment, two things, to render it
infallacious, are to be noted. That the said *Salts* were not dissolved
by the help of *Fire*, but only by a strong and continued *Agitation*.
And that this was done upon a warm day: which I mention, because
that even the changes of the weather will somewhat alter the *Solubility*
of the *Salts*.

11. §. Having made the Experiment upon two *Salts*, I proceeded to
repeat it upon three. And first I dissolved as much common *Salt* in
℥ij of *Water*, as that quantity would bear. Then having separated
the subsiding portion; I put to the *Solution*, no less than five Drachms
of *Nitre*, which by a continued *Agitation*, was wholly dissolved therein,
neither the *Nitre* nor the common *Salt* being in the least precipitated.
Then adding a Scruple more, it would not dissolve, but subsided. This
second subsiding portion, I again separated; and then put to this *Superimpregnation*,
near ʒj of *Sal Armoniac*, which was also dissolved as the
former. And if as many more *Salts* had been added, ’tis probable that
the same *Water* would have born some quantity of them all.

12. §. From this Experiment, it is a Conclusion demonstrated,
That not only the visible *Crystals*, but the very *Atomes* of every *Salt*,
at least those *Particles* which are ultimately dissolved in *Water*, have a
different *Figure* one from another. Because that if they were all of
one *Figure*; there would be no *Superimpregnation*, but the *Pores* of
the same *Water*, would imbibe as much of one *Salt*, as answers to the
total of two more *Salts* imbibed: that is to say, it would as well
imbibe two Ounces of common *Salt*, as one Ounce of common *Salt* and

another of *Nitre*: which yet is contrary to the Experiment. And it
is the same thing, whether we suppose the *Pores* of *Water* to be also
different, or not. Because, that if the *Figure* of all the said *Atomes* be
the same; then their respect to the *Pores* of the *Water* must be the
same, how different so ever those *Pores* be: which is also contrary to
the Experiment. Besides it is a great presumption, to say, that the
*Pores*, and therefore the *Atomes* of *Water* have different *Figures*; and
yet not those of *Salts*.

13. §. From the same Experiment we may go upon good ground in
*Compounded Infusions*; whether of *Purgative*, or other *Materials*. As
not doubting, but that the same *Menstruum* may be highly impregnated
with several *Ingredients* at once, whose operative parts may be therein
copiously dissolved, without hindring either an *Extraction*, or causing
a *Precipitation* one of an other.

14. §. The *Second* Enquiry is, With what difference this *Superimpregnation*
of *Water* is made? which I find considerable. For a *Solution*
of above five Drachms of *Nitre* may be *superimpregnated* with no
less quantity of *Sal Armoniac*. And a *Solution* of five Drachms of common
*Salt*, may be *superimpregnated* with as much *Nitre*. Yet neither
a strong *Solution* (as of five Drachms) of common *Salt*, will bear above
two Scruples of *Sal Armoniac*: nor will a strong *Solution* (as of five
Drachms) of *Sal Armoniac*, bear above a Drachm of common *Salt*: for
if above the said quantities of either of them be mixed together: they
are both copiously and forthwith precipitated to the bottome of the
*Glass*.

15. §. Whence, notwithstanding the former Experiment, yet are
we admonished, not to infuse all manner of *Ingredients* in any proportion.
Because though some do not, yet others will precipitate one
another.

16. §. The *Third* Enquiry was this, Whether the *Solution* of a
smaller quantity of several *Salts*, doth consist with the *non-increase* of
the *Bulk* of the *Water*? For this I took a *Bolthead* with a slender *Neck*,
conteining about a pint and a quarter of *Water*; and dissolved therein
about ℥jß of *Nitre*. And marking the place to which the *Water*
ascended in the *Neck* of the *Bolthead*: I then dissolved in the same *Water*
about a Drachm of *Sal Gemmæ*: which little quantity, raised the
*Water* above half an Inch higher then it was before. The like I observed
in the addition of *Nitre* to a *Solution* of *Sal Armoniac*. So that
to suppose the variation of the *Salt* doth prevent the increase of the *Bulk*
of the *Water*, is a manifest Error.

17. §. From the same Experiment it also appears, That the ascent
of the *Water* upon a *Superimpregnation*, is the same, by whatsoever *Salt*
the first *Impregnation* be made. For instance, Let a *Solution* of *Nitre*
ascend in the *Neck* of the *Bolthead*, suppose, to 10 Inches, then add
½ an Ounce more of *Nitre*, so as to raise the *Water*, suppose, 12 Inches
or more, or less, according to the *Bore* of the *Neck*. In like manner,
let a *Solution* of *Sal Armoniac* reach to ten Inches: then add again half
an Ounce of *Nitre*; and it will reach just 12 Inches, or more or less,
as before.

18. §. The *Fourth* Enquiry is, What quantity of the several kinds
of *Salt*, may be dissolved severally in the same quantity of *Water*:
that is to say, by agitation alone, without the help of fire, as I noted

before. And upon tryal it appears, First, that two Ounces of *Water*
will dissolve three Ounces of *Loaf-Sugar* and no more, except the
*Water* be heated.

19. §. The same quantity of *Water* that is, two Ounces will dissolve
above two Ounces of *Salt* of *Tartar*. I say above, for how much
more, want of a greater quantity of *Salt* which I could confide in,
made me that I could not finish the Experiment.

20. §. The same quantity, *sc.* two Ounces of *Water*, dissolveth an
Ounce and a Drachm of *Green Vitriol*.

21. §. The like quantity dissolveth six Drachms and a Scruple or
above ¾ of an Ounce of common *Salt*.

22. §. Of *Nitre*, Five Drachms two Scruples and an half.

23. §. Of *Sal Armoniac*, five Drachms and two Scruples.

24. §. Of *Alum*, not above two Drachms and a Scruple.

25. §. And of *Borax*, not above a Drachm and half a Scruple.

26. §. Of these note, That although Common *Salt* be very dissoluble,
and will presently catch the moysture of the *Aer*: yet a much
greater quantity not only of *Salt* of *Tartar*, but even of *Loaf Sugar*,
and of *Green Vitriol* it self, may be dissolved in *Water* than of Common
*Salt*.

27. §. Again, as the great *Solubility* of some, so the less *Solubility*
of other *Salts* is also observable, as of *Alum*, and *Borax*. For the same
quantity of *Water* will dissolve near four times as much of *Green Vitriol*,
as it will of *Alum*. And of *Sugar* more than ten times as much. Of
*Green Vitriol* near eight times as much as of *Borax*; and of *Sugar*, twenty
times as much.

28. §. From this Experiment we are likewise cautioned, not only
in the *Infusion* of several *Ingredients* together, but of any one singly;
that such a proportion thereof to the *Menstruum*, be not exceeded.
For all that is over and above what the *Menstruum* will bear, is either not
extracted, or will be precipitated. As is evident not only in the *Dissolution*
of the *Salts* above named, but in the *Infusion* of *Plants* themselves:
as, for instance, of *Senna*; two Drachms whereof will impregnate
four Ounces of *Water* as strongly, as if twice the quantity were infused;
because the *Water* will bear no more of the *Purgative Parts* of that
*Body*.

29. §. There is only one *Salt* more remaineth to be spoken of under
this Experiment; and that is, the *Crystals* of *Tartar*. Whereof,
it is somewhat strange to observe, that it will scarce at all dissolve in
*Water*: not more, than even divers *Resinous Gums*, as *Mastick*, *Tolu*,
*Tacchamahacca*, and some others will do. For if two Drachms, suppose
of these *Crystals*, of *Tartar* (commonly sold for *Cremor Tartari*)
be put to one Ounce of *Water*, scarce five Grains thereof will, by *Agitation*,
be therein dissolved.
