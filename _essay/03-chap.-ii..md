### Of the ROOT.

![H](images/i_drop_h_019.jpg)
AVING
 Examin’d and pursu’d the Degrees of
*Vegetation* in the *Seed*, we find its two *Lobes* have
here their utmost period: and, that having conveyed
their *Seminalities* into the *Radicle* and *Plume*; these
therefore, as the *Root* and *Trunk* of the *Plant*, still
survive. Of these, in their order, we next proceed
to speak; and first, of the *Root*: whereof, as
well as of the *Seed*, we must by Dissection inform our selves.

2. §. In Dissection of a *Root* then, we shall find it with the *Radicle*,
as the *Parts* of an Old Man with those of a *Fœtus*, substantially,
one. The first *Part* occurring is its *Skin*, the Original whereof is
from the *Seed*: For that extreme thin *Cuticle* which is spread over the
*Lobes* of the *Seed*, and from thence over the *Radicle*, upon the
shooting of the *Radicle* into a *Root*, is co-extended, and becomes its
*Skin*.

3. §. The next *Part* is the *Cortical Body*. Which, when it is thin,
is commonly called the *Barque*. The Original hereof, likewise is
from the *Seed*; or the *Parenchyma*, which is there common both to
the *Lobes* and *Radicle*, being by *Vegetation* augmented and prolonged
into the *Root*, the same becomes the *Parenchyma* of the *Barque*. *Tab. 2. f. 4.*

4. §. The Contexture of this *Parenchyma* may be well illustrated
by that of a *Sponge*, being a Body Porous, Dilative and Pliable. Its
*Pores*, as they are innumerable, so, extream small. These *Pores* are
not only susceptive of so much Moisture as to fill, but also to enlarge
themselves, and so to dilate the *Cortical Body* wherein they are: which
by the shriv’ling in thereof, upon its being expos’d to the Air, is also
seen. In which dilatation, many of its Parts becoming more lax and
distant, and none of them suffering a solution of their continuity; ’tis
a Body also sufficiently pliable; that is to say, a *most exquisitely fine-wrought
Sponge*.

5. §. The Extention of these *Pores* is much alike by the length
and breadth of the *Root*; which from the shrinking up of the *Cortical
Body*, in a piece of a cut *Root*, by the same dimensions, is argu’d.

6. §. The proportions of this *Cortical Body* are various: If thin,
’tis, as is said, called a *Barque*; and thought to serve to no other end,
than what is vulgarly ascrib’d to a *Barque*; which is a narrow conceit.
If a Bulky Body, in comparison with That within it, as in the young
*Roots* of *Cichory*, *Asparagus*, &c. ’tis here, because the fairest, therefore
taken for the prime *Part*; which, though, as to Medicinal use,
it is; yet, as to the private use of the *Plant*, not so. The Colour
hereof, though it be originally white, yet in the continued growth of
the *Root*, divers *Tinctures*, as yellow in *Dock*, *red* in *Bistort*, are thereinto
introduced.

7. §. Next within this Part stands the *Lignous Body*: This *Lignous
Body*, lyeth with all its parts, so far as they are visible, in a Circle
or *Ring*. *Tab. 2. f. 4.* b.  Yet are there divers extreme small *Fibres* thereto parallel,
usually mixed with the *Cortical Body*; and by the somewhat different
colour of the said *Cortical Body* where they stand, may be noted.
These *Fibres* the *Cortical Body*, and *Skin*, altogether, properly
make the *Barque*. The Original of this *Lignous Body*, as of the two
former, is from the *Seed*; or, the *Seminal Roots* of both the *Lobes*, being
united in the *Radicle*, and with its *Parenchyma* co-extended, is here
in the *Root* of the *Plant*, the *Lignous Body*.

8. §. The Contexture hereof, in many of its parts, is much more
close than that of the *Cortical*; and their *Pores* very different. For
whereas those of the *Cortical* are infinitely numerous, these of the *Lignous*
are in comparison nothing so. But these, although fewer, yet
are they, many of them, more open, fair and visible: as in a very thin
Slice cut athwart the young *Root* of a *Tree*, and held up against the
light, is apparent. Yet not in all equally; in *Coran*-Tree, *Goosberry*-Tree,
*&c.* less, in *Oak*, *Plums*, and especially *Damascens*, more; *Tab. 2. f. 5.*  in
*Elder*, *Vines*, *&c.* most conspicuous. And as they are different in
number and size, so also (whereon the numerousness of the *Pores* of the
*Cortical Body* principally depends) in their shape. For whereas those
of the *Cortical Body* are extended much alike both by the length and
breadth of the *Root*; these of the *Lignous*, are only by the length;
which especially in *Vines*, and some other *Roots* is evident. Of these
*Pores*, ’tis also observable, that although in all places of the *Root* they
are visible, yet most fair and open about the *filamentous Extremities* of
some *Roots*, *Tab. 2. f. 7.* a. b.  where about, the *Roots* have no *Pith*; as in *Fenil*. And
in many *Roots*, higher.

9. §. The proportion betwixt this *Lignous Body* and the *Cortical*,
is various, as was said; yet in this, constant, *sc.* that in the *filamentous*
and smaller Parts of the *Root*, the *Lignous Body* is very much the less;
running like a slender *Wyer* or *Nerve* through the other surrounding
it. Whereas in the upper part, it is often times of far greater quantity
than the *Cortical*, although it be encompass’d by it. They stand
both together pyramidally, which is most common to *Infant Roots*, but
also to a great many others.

10. §. The next *Part* observable in the *Root*, is the *Insertment*. The
existence hereof, so far as we can yet observe, is sometimes in the *Radicle*
of the *Seed* it self; I cannot say always. As to its substantial nature,
we are more certain; that it is the same with that of the *Parenchyma*
of the *Radicle*; being always at least augmented, and so, in part,
originated from the *Cortical Body*, and so, at second hand, from the said
*Parenchyma*. For in dissecting a *Root*, I find, that the *Cortical Body*
doth not only environ the *Lignous*, but is also wedg’d, and in many
Pieces *inserted* into it; and that the said inserted Pieces make not a
meer Indenture, but transmit and shoot themselves quite through as
far as the *Pith*: *Tab. 2. f. 5.*  which in a thin Slice cut athwart the *Root*, as so many
lines drawn from the Circumference towards the Center, shew themselves.

11. §. The *Pores* of the *Insertment* are sometimes, at least, extended
somewhat more by the breadth of the *Root*, as about the top of
the *Root* of *Borage* may be seen; and are thus different from those of

the *Cortical Body*, which are extended by the length and breadth much
alike; and from those of the *Lignous*, being only by its length.

12. §. The number and size of these Insertions are various. In
*Hawthorn*, and some others, and especially *Willows*, they are most extream
small; in *Cherries* and *Plums* they are Biger; *Tab. 2. f. 5. & 6.*  and in the *Vine*
and some other *Trees*, very fairly apparent. In the *Roots* of most
*Herbs* they are generally more easily discoverable; which may lead to
the observation of them in all.

13. §. These *Insertions*, although they are continuous through
both the length and breadth of the *Root*; yet not so in all Parts, but
by the several shootings of the *Lignous Body* they are frequently intercepted.
For of the *Lignous Body* it is (here best) observable;
That its several *Shootings*, betwixt which the *Cortical* is inserted, are
not, throughout the *Root*, wholly distinct, strait and parallel; but
that all along being enarch’d, the *Lignous Body*, both in length and
breadth, is thus disposed into *Braces* or *Osculations*. Betwixt these
several *Shootings* of the *Lignous Body* thus osculated, the *Cortical*
shooting, *Tab. 2. f. 8.*  and being also osculated answerably *Brace* for *Brace*, that
which I call the *Insertment* is framed thereof.

14. §. These *Osculations* are so made, that the *Pores* or *Fibres* of
the *Lignous Body*, I think, notwithstanding, seldom or never run one
into another; being, though contiguous, yet still distinct. In
the same manner as some of the *Nerves*, though they meet, and for
some space are associated together, yet ’tis most probable, that none
of their *Fibres* are truly inosculated, saving perhaps, in the *Plexures*.

15. §. These *Osculations* of the *Lignous Body*, and so the interception
of the *Insertions* of the *Cortical*, are not to be observ’d by the
traverse cut of the *Root*, but by taking off the *Barque*. In the
*Roots* of *Trees*, they are generally obscure; but in *Herbs* often more
distinctly apparent; and especially in a *Turnep*: the appearance whereof,
the *Barque* being stripp’d off, is as a piece of close-wrought Net-work,
fill’d up with the *Insertions* from thence.

16. §. The next and last distinct *Part* of the *Root* is the *Pith*. The
substantial nature thereof, is, as was said of the *Insertment*, the same
likewise with that of the *Parenchyma* of the *Seed*. And according to
the best observation I have yet made, ’tis sometimes existent in its *Radicle*;
in which, the two main *Branches* of the *Lobes* both meeting,
and being osculated together, are thus dispos’d into one round and
tubular *Trunk*, and so environing part of the *Parenchyma*, make thereof
a *Pith*; as in either the *Radicle*, or the young *Root* of the great *Bean*
or *Lupine*, may, I think, be well seen.

17. §. But many times the Original hereof is immediately from
the *Barque*. For in dissection of divers *Roots*, both of *Trees* and *Herbs*,
as of *Barberry* or *Mallows*, it is observable, That the *Cortical Body* and
*Pith*, are both of them participant of the same Colour; in the *Barberry*,
both of them tinged yellow, and in *Mallows*, green. In cutting the
smaller Parts of the *Roots* of many *Plants*, as of *Borage*, *Mallows*, *Parsley*,
*Columbine*, *&c.* ’tis also evident, That the *Lignous Body* is not
there, in the least Concave, but standeth Solid, or without any *Pith*, *Tab. 2. f. 9.* a. 
in the Center; and that the *Insertions* being gradually multiplied afterwards,
the *Pith*, at length, towards the thicker parts of the *Root*,
shews and enlarges it self. Whence it appears, that in all such *Roots*,

the *Pith* is not only of the same substantial nature, and by the *Insertions*
doth communicate with the *Barque*; and that it is also augmented
by it; which is true of the *Pith* of all *Roots*; but is moreover,
by mediation of the said *Insertions*, wholly originated from it;
that is to say, from the *Parenchymous* Part thereof. The various appearances
of the *Insertions* and *Pith* from the filamentous *Parts* to the
top of the *Root*, see in *Tab. 2*. *Tab. 2. f. 9.*  The *Pores* of the *Lignous Body*, as
it stands entire in the said filamentous *Parts*, are best seen when they
have lain by a night to dry, after cutting.

18. §. A farther evidence hereof are the Proportions betwixt the
*Cortical Body* and *Pith*. For as about the inferiour Parts of the *Root*,
where the *Pith* is small, the *Cortical Body* is proportionably great; so
about the top, where the *Pith* is enlarged, the *Cortical Body* (now more
properly becoming a *Barque*) groweth proportionably less, *sc.* because
the *Insertions* do still more and more enlarge the *Pith*. Likewise the
peculiar frame of some *Roots*, wherein besides the *Pith*, the *Lignous
Body* being divided into two or more *Rings*, there are also one or more
thick *Rings*, of a white and soft substance, which stand betwixt them;
and are nothing else but the *Insertions* of the *Cortical Body* collected
into the said *Rings*; but, towards the top of the *Root*, being inserted
again, thus make a large and ample *Pith*; *Tab. 2. f. 8.*  as in older *Fennel*-Roots, those
of *Beet*, *Turnep*, and some other *Herbs*, is seen.

19. §. The *Pores* of the *Pith*, as those of the *Cortical Body*, are
extended both by the breadth and length of the *Root*, much alike; yet
are they more or less of a greater size than those of the *Cortical
Body*.

20. §. The Proportions of the *Pith*, are various; in *Trees*, but
small; in *Herbs*, generally, very fair; in some making by far the greatest
part of the *Root*; as in a *Turnep*: By reason of the wide circumference
whereof, and so the finer Concoction and Assimilation of its
Sap; that *Part* which in most old *Trunks* is a dry and harsh *Pith*, here
proves a tender, pleasant meat.

21. §. In the *Roots* of very many *Plants*, as *Turneps*, *Carrots*, *&c.*
the *Lignous Body*, besides its main utmost *Ring*, hath divers of its *osculated
Fibres* dispersed throughout the Body of the *Pith*; sometimes
all alike, and sometimes more especially in, or near, its Center; which
*Fibres*, as they run towards the top of the *Root*, still declining the
Center, at last collaterally strike into its Circumference; either all of
them, or some few, keeping the Center still. Of these principally, the
Succulent part of the *Lignous Body* of the *Trunk* is often originated.

22. §. Some of these *Pith-Fibres*, although they are so exceeding
slender, yet in some *Roots*, as in that of *Flower de liz*, they are visibly
concave, each of them, in their several Cavities also embosoming a very
small *Pith*; the sight whereof, the *Root* being cut traverse, and laid
in a Window for a day or two to dry, may without *Glasses* be obtain’d.
And this is the general account of the *Root*; the declaration of the manner
of its growth, with the use and service of its several *Parts*, we shall
next endeavour.

An Account of the Growth of the *Root*.
23. §. I SAY THEN, That the *Radicle* being impregnate, and
shot into the Moulds, the contiguous moisture, by the *Cortical Body*, being
a Body laxe and Spongy, is easily admitted: Yet not all indiscriminately,
but that which is more adapted to pass through the surrounding

*Cuticle*. Which transient *Sap*, though it thus becomes fine, yet is not
simple; but a mixture of *Particles*, both in respect of those originally
in the *Root*, and amongst themselves, somewhat heterogeneous. And
being lodg’d in the *Cortical Body* moderately laxe, and of a Circular
form; the effect will be an easie Fermentation. The *Sap* fermenting,
a separation of *Parts* will follow; some whereof will be impacted
to the Circumference of the *Cortical Body*, whence the *Cuticle* becomes
a *Skin*; as we see in the growing of the Coats of Cheeses, of
the Skin over divers Liquors, and the like. Whereupon the *Sap*
passing into the *Cortical Body*, through this, as through a *Manica Hippocratis*,
is still more finely filtred. With which *Sap*, the *Cortical
Body* being dilated as far as its *Tone*, without a solution of Continuity,
will bear; and the supply of the *Sap* still renew’d: the purest part,
as most apt and ready, recedes, with its due *Tinctures*, from the said
*Cortical Body*, to all the parts of the *Lignous*; both those mixed with
the *Barque*, and those lying within it. Which *Lignous Body* likewise
super-inducing its own proper *Tinctures* into the said *Sap*; ’tis
now to its highest preparation wrought up, and becomes (as they speak
of that of an Animal) the Vegetative *Ros* or *Cambium*: the noblest
part whereof is at last coagulated in, and assimilated to the like substance
with the said *Lignous Body*. The remainder, though not united
to it, yet tinctur’d therein, thus retreats, that is, by the continual
appulse of the *Sap*, is in part carried off into the *Cortical Body* back
again, the *Sap* whereof it now tinctures into good *Aliment*. So
that whereas before, the *Cortical Body* was only relaxed in its Parts, and
so dilated; ’tis now increas’d in real quantity or number of parts, and
so is truly nourish’d. And the *Cortical Body* being saturate with so
much of this Vital *Sap* as serves it self; and the second Remainders
discharged thence to the *Skin*; this also is nourish’d and augmented
therewith. So that as in an *Animal Body* there is no instauration or
growth of Parts made by the *Bloud* only, but the *Nervous Spirit* is also
thereunto assistant; so is it here: the *Sap* prepared in the *Cortical
Body*, is as the *Bloud*, and that part thereof prepared by the *Lignous*, is
as the *Nervous Spirit*; which partly becoming Nutriment to it self,
and partly being discharged back into the *Cortical Body*, and diffusing
its Tincture through the *Sap* there, that to the said *Cortical Body* and
*Skin*, becomes also true Nutriment, and so they all now grow.

24. §. In which growth, a proportion in length and breadth is requisite:
which being rated by the benefit of the *Plant*, both for firm
standing and sufficient *Sap*, must therefore principally be in length.
And because it is thus requisite, therefore by the constitution of one
of its *Parts*, *sc.* the *Lignous Body*, it is also made necessary. For the
*Pores* hereof, in that they are all extended by its length, the *Sap* also
according to the frame and site of the said *Pores* will principally move;
and that way as its *Sap* moves, the same way will the generation of its
Parts also proceed; *sc.* by its length. And the *Lignous Body* first (that
is by a *priority causal*) moving in length it self; the *Cortical* also moves
therewith. For that which is nourish’d, is extended: but whatever
is extended, is mov’d: that therefore which is nourish’d, is mov’d:
The *Lignous Body* then being first nourish’d, ’tis likewise first mov’d,
and so becomes and carries in it the Principle of all Vegetative motion
in the *Cortical*; and so they both move in length.

25. §. Yet as the *Lignous Body* is the *Principle* of Motion in the
*Cortical*; so the *Cortical* is the *Moderator* of that in the *Lignous*: As in
Animal Motions, the *Principle* is from the *Nerves*; yet being once given
to the *Muscle* or *Limb*, and that moving proportionably to its structure,
the *Nerves* also are carried in the same motion with it. We suppose
therefore, that as the principal motion of the *Lignous Body* is in
length, so is its *proper tendency* also to *Ascend*. But being much exceeded
both in Compass and Quantity by the *Cortical*, as in the smaller parts
of the *Root* it is; it must needs therefore be over-born and governed
by it; and so, though not lose its motion, yet make it that way wherein
the *Cortical Body* may be more obedient to it; which will be by descent.
Yet both of them being sufficiently pliable, they are thus capable,
where the Soyl may oppose a direct descent, there to divert any
way, where it is more penetrable, and so to descend obliquely. For
the same reason it may also be, that though you set a *Bean* with the
*Radicle* upward; yet the *Radicle*, as it shoots, declining also gradually,
is thus arch’d in form of an Hook, and so at last descends. For
every declination from a perpendicular Line, is a mixed motion betwixt
Ascent and Descent, as that of the *Radicle* also is, and so seeming
to be dependent upon the two *Contrary Tendencies* of the *Lignous*
and *Cortical Bodies*. What may be the cause of those *Tendencies* (being
most probably external, and a kind of *Magnetisme*) I shall not make
my Task here to enquire.

26. §. Now although the *Lignous Body*, by the position and shape
of its *Pores*, principally groweth in length; yet will it in some degree
likewise in breadth: For it cannot be supposed that the purest *Sap* is
all received into the said *Pores*; but that part thereof likewise, staying
about its *Superficial Parts*, is there tinctur’d and agglutinated to them.
And because these *Pores* are prolonged by its length; therefore it is
much more laxe and easily divisible that way; as in slitting a Stick, or
cleaving of Timber, and in cutting and hewing them athwart is also
seen. Whence it comes to pass, that in shooting from the Center towards
the Circumference, and there finding more room, its said original
*Laxity* doth easily in divers places now become greater, and at
length in open *Partments* plainly visible. Betwixt which *Partments*,
the *Cortical Body*, being bound in on the one hand, by the surrounding
*Skin* and *Moulds*, and pressed upon by the *Lignous* on the other,
must needs insert it self, and so move contrary to it, from the Circumference
*towards* the *Center*. Where the said contrary motions continued
as begun, they at last meet, unite, and either make or augment the
*Pith*. And thus the *Root* is fram’d, and the *Skin*, the *Cortical* and
*Lignous Bodies*, so as is said, thereunto concurrent. We shall next shew the
use of the two other *Parts*, *sc.* the *Insertment* and *Pith*; and first of the
*Pith*.

27. §. ONE true use of the *Pith* is for the better Advancement of
the *Sap*, whereof I shall speak in the next Chapter. The use I here
observe, is for the quicker and higher Fermentation of the *Sap*: For
although the Fermentation made in the *Cortical Body* was well subservient
to the first *Vegetations*, yet those more perfect ones in the *Trunk*
which after follow, require a Body more adapted to it, and that is the
*Pith*; which is so necessary, as not to be only common to, but considerably
large in the *Roots* of most *Plants*; if not in their inferiour

parts, yet at their tops. Where though either deriv’d or amplify’d
from the *Cortical Body*, yet being by its *Insertions* only, we may therefore
suppose, as those, so this, to be more finely constituted. And
being also from its coarctation, while inserted, now free; all its *Pores*,
upon the supply of the *Sap*, will more or less be amplified: Upon
which accounts, the *Sap* thereinto received, will be more pure, and
its fermentation therein more active. And as the *Pith* is superiour to
the *Cortical Body* by its *Constitution*, so by its *Place*. For as it thus
stands central, it hath the *Lignous Body* surrounding it. Now as the
*Skin* is the Fence of the *Cortical Body*, and that of the *Lignous*; so is
the *Lignous* again a far more preheminent one unto the *Pith*; the *Sap*
being here a brisk Liquor, *tunn’d up* as in a wooden *Cask*.

28. §. And as the *Pith* subserves the higher Fermentation of the
*Sap*; so do the *Insertions* its purer Distribution; that separation which
the parts of the *Sap*, by being fermented in the *Pith*, were dispos’d for;
being, upon its entrance into the *Insertions*, now made: So that as the
*Skin* is a *Filtre* to the *Cortical Body*, so are the *Insertions* a more preheminent
one to the *Lignous*. And as they subserve the purer, so the
freer and sufficient distribution of the *Sap*: For the *Root* enlarging,
and so the *Lignous Body* growing thicker, although the *Cortical* and the
*Pith* might supply *Sap* sufficient to the nutrition of its *Parts* next adjacent
to them; yet those more inward, must needs be scanted of their
*Aliment*; and so, if not quite starved, yet be uncapable of equal growth:
Whereas the *Lignous Body* being through its whole breadth frequently
disparted, and the *Cortical Body* inserted through it; the *Sap* by those
*Insertions*, as the *Bloud* by the disseminations of the *Arteries*, is freely
and sufficiently convey’d to its intimate Parts, even those, which from
either the *Barque* or from the *Pith*, are most remote. Lastly, as the
consequent hereof, they are thus assistant to the *Latitudinal growth* of
the *Root*; as the *Lignous Body* to its growth in Length; so these *Insertions*
of the *Cortical*, to its better growth in Breadth.

29. §. Having thus seen the solitary uses of the Several *Parts* of
the *Root*, I shall lastly propound my Conjectures of that Design whereto
they are altogether concurrent, and that is the *Circulation* of the
*Sap*.

30. §. That the *Sap* hath a Double, and so a *Circular* Motion, in
the *Root*; is probable, from the proper Motion of the *Root*, and from
its Office. From its Motion, which is Descent: for which, the *Sap*
must likewise, some where, have such a Motion proper to it. From
its Office, which is, To feed the *Trunk*: for which, the *Sap* must also,
in some *Part* or other, have a more especial Motion of Ascent.

31. §. We may therefore suppose, That the *Sap* moving in the
*Barque*, towards the *Pith*, through the *Insertions*, thereinto obtains
a pass, Which passage, the upper *Insertions* will not favour;
because the *Pith* standing in the same height with them, is there large,
the fermenting and course of the *Sap* quick, and so its opposition
strong. But through the lower it will much more easily enter; because
there, from the smallness of the *Pith*, the opposition is little, and
from the shortness of the *Insertions*, the way more open. So that the
*Sap* here meeting with the least opposition, here it will bestow it self
(feeding the *Lignous Body* in its passage) into the *Pith*. Into which,
fresh *Sap* still entring, this being yet but crude, will subside: that

first receiv’d, and so become a Liquor higher wrought, will more easily
mount upwards. And moving in the *Pith*, especially in the *Sap-Fibers*
there dispers’d, as in the *Arterys*, in equal altitude with the upper-*Insertions*;
the most volatile parts of all will still continue their direct ascent
towards the *Trunk*. But those of a middle nature, and, as not
apt to ascend, so being lighter than those beneath them, not to descend
neither; they will tend from the *Pith* towards the *Insertions* in a Motion
betwixt both. Through which *Insertions* (feeding the *Lignous
Body* in its passage) it is, by the next subsequent *Sap*, discharged off
into the *Cortical Body*, and so into the *Sap-Fibres* themselves, as into
the *Veins*, back again. Wherein, being still pursu’d by fresh *Sap*
from the Center, and more occurring from the Circumference, towards
the lower *Insertions*, it thus descends. Through which, together
with part of the *Sap* afresh imbib’d from the Earth, it re-enters the
*Pith*. From whence, into the *Cortical Body*, and from thence into
the *Pith*, the cruder part thereof, is reciprocally disburs’d; while
the most *Volatile*, not needing the help of a *Circulation*, more directly
ascendeth towards the *Trunk*.
