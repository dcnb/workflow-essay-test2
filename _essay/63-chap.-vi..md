### CHAP. VI.

### Of the GENERATION of the SEED.

![A](images/i_drop_a_143.jpg)
S
 I made choice of a *Garden-Bean*, to shew the manner
    of the *Vegetation* of the *Seed*: so I shall take
    an *Aprecock*, as very apt and convenient, to observe
    and represent the *Method* which *Nature* taketh
    in its *Generation*.

2. §. In order to do this, the first thing that is to
    be done, is to make a fit *Uterus*. Both to keep
    the *Membranes* of the *Fœtus* warm, and succulent,
    till it be formed: and to preserve and secure the *Fœtus* it self afterwards,
    till it comes to be born into the *Ground*.

3. §. For this purpose, the *Pulp* and *Stone* of the *Fruit* are both
    necessary; but primarily the *Stone*: the *Meat* or *Pulp* being no otherwise
    necessary, but because the *Stone* cannot be made without it; the
    petrifying of that *Parenchyma* which is the *Ground* of the *Stone*, being
    effected, by the sinking or the *Tartar* from the *Pulp* thereinto.

4. §. And that, at the first, the *Ground* of the *Stone*, is a distinct,
    but soft *Parenchyma*; is evident in the cuting of a young *Aprecock*.
    Of which, also a slice cut off, with a *Rasor*, and viewed through a
    good *Glass*, sheweth it to be composed of *Bladders*, as the *Pulp* it
    self. *Tab. 82.* Only, whereas many of those of the *Pulp* are large, now about
    as big as a white *Pepper-Corn*: these are no bigger than a *Mustard-Seed*.
    But as the *Parenchyma* hardens into a *Stone*, these *Bladders*
    are all gradually filled up, and disappear.

5. §. This *Parenchyma* is derived immediately from the *Pith*, as the
    *Pulp* is from the *Barque*; and makes the far greater part of the *Stone*.
    ’Tis covered all over within, with a very thin *Lining*; derived, not from
    the *Pith* but the *Parenchyma* which covers the *Seed-Branch*, upon its first
    entrance within the hollow of the *Stone*. This *Lining* is of a close
    substance; yet composed of *Bladders*, exquisitely small and hardly visible.
    By which means, it soon becomes a very hard and dry *Body*; *Tab. 80.* and is
    hereby fitted, both to promote the induration of the rest of the *Stone*;
    and the seasonable drying, and so, the shrinking up, of the *Covers* of
    the *Seed*, to make room for its *Growth*.

6. §. The *Stone* being made hard and dry; it could never be so
    sufficiently softned by lying under ground, but that, it would keep the
    *Seed* a perpetual prisoner, unless it were also made pretty easily to cleave
    in two. For which purpose, the *Skin* of the *Fruit* doth observably
    conduce. *Tab. 80.* For in a *Slice* of a young *Aprecock* cut transversly with a
    very sharp knife, it may be seen, especially with the help of a *Glass*, to
    be doubled inward from the two *Lips* of the *Fruit*, and so to be continued,

    not only through the *Pulp*, but also through the *Stone* it self,
    into the hollow of the same, where it meets, and is united with the
    *Lining* thereof. Whereby, as it further helps to the drying and hardning
    of the *Stone*; so also renders it cleavable in that part, where it runs
    through it. And therefore, whereas towards the *Stalk*, it goes no farther
    than to the *Seed-Branch*, and so but half way through the *Stone*:
    towards the *Top* of the *Fruit*, where the *Radicle* stands, and where
    the *Stone* begins to cleave, it runs quite through it.

7. §. *Nature* having thus provided a convenient *Uterus*, She next
    taketh care about the *Membranes* of the *Fœtus*. These are *Three* apparently
    distinct, and in many respects different one from another.

8. §. The outer *Membrane* is derived from the *Parenchyma* which
    surrounds the *Seed-Branch*; which, upon its entry into the hollow of
    the *Stone*, is expanded, as it were, into two *Bladders*, one within another;
    *Tab. 80.* whereof, one becomes the *Lining* of the *Stone*; the other,
    this outer *Membrane*: as is best seen by cuting a young *Aprecock*, when
    it is about half an Inch long, down through the midle, or from the *Seat*
    of the *Flower* to the *Stalk*, between the two *Lips*.

9. §. This outer *Membrane*, at this age, hath a good full and frim
    *Body*, about 1/12ᵗʰ of an Inch thick, or through an ordinary *Glass*, half an
    Inch, where it is thickest, as at the *Sides* and the greater end: the
    *Poynt* being thinner, for the more easy eruption of the *Radicle* into the
    *Earth*. *Tab. 80.* Composed of *Bladders*, through an ordinary *Glass*, about as
    big, as a *Colewort-Seed*.

10. §. Throughout this *Membrane*, the *Vessels* conteined in the
    *Seed-Branch* are distributed. Beginning a little below the smaller end of
    the *Coat* or *Membrane*, they thence fetch their circuit both ways round
    about, just beneath the *Surface* of the *Membrane*, and at last, meet in
    the midle of the greater end, where they are all inosculated, so as to
    make a kind of *umbilical Node*. *Tab. 80.* From whence they strike deeper into
    it, and at last, into the midle *Membrane*, in which they presently become
    invisible. By these *Vessels*, the *Sap* is brought and spewed into the midle
    *Membrane*. So that the outer *Membrane* seemeth, in some respects, to
    be answerable to the *Placenta* in *Animals*.

11. §. The midle *Membrane*, is derived from the bottome of the
Outer. From whence especially, but also round about, the *Bladders*
hereof (all angular) are more and more amplified towards the *Centre*;
most of them being at least two hundred times biger, than those of the
Outer *Membrane*: *Tab. 80.* whereby it looks, through a *Glass*, not unlike a
*Coome* full of *Hony*; or in regard of their great transparency, like a
company of little *Crystal Pans* full of a pure *Lympha*.

12. §. This Midle *Membrane*, is properly so called, from the state
and condition it hath, upon the *Augmentation* of the *Seed*, at which
time, it obteins the nature of an *Involucrum*. But originally, it is
every where entire, without any *Hollow*, filling up the *Cavity* of the
Outer *Membrane*, like a soft and delicate *Pulp*. After a short time,

there appears in it a small *Ductus* or *Chanel*; which runs from the bottom
to the top, like an *Axis*, through the midle of it.*Tab. 81.* At first,
no wider than to receive the *Hair* of a *Mans Head*; not visible, except
in a slice hereof cut transversly, and viewed in a *Glass*. Being
grown a little wider, it may be seen, if the *Membrane* be dexterously
cut by the length. At which time, it is also dilated into two *Oval
Cavities*, one at each end: which are as two little *Cisterns*, whereinto
a most pure *Lympha* continually owzeth, and is therein reserved for
the nourishment of the *Seed*; and through the *Chanel* which runs between
the *Cisterns* is emptied out of one *Cistern* into another, according
as the *Seed* or the Inmost *Membrane* hath need of it; *i. e.* as the *Weather*
and other Circumstances do more or less accelerate their *Growth*,
and so render the *Lympha* useful to them.

13. §. A few days after this, the Innermost *Membrane* begins to
appear; growing, like a soft *Node* or *Bud*, out of the upper *Cistern*;
to the lower end of which it is joyned by a short and tender *Stalk*, *Tab. 81.* from
whence it is produced into a *Conick-oval Figure*, answerable to that of
the *Cistern*.

14. §. This *Membrane*, though soft and full of *Sap*, yet being
compared with the midlemost, is a close and compact *Body*, composed
of *Bladders* above 300 times smaller than they are in that. Whereby,
as the *Seed* is so well guarded, as not to be supplyed with any part of
the *Lympha*, but the purest: so neither with any more of this, than
will suffice, without the danger of making an *Inundation* out of so great
a *Lake*.

15. §. This *Membrane*, if it be pulled with a most steady hand, and
very gently, upwards, it will draw a small transparent *String* after it
to the bottom of the Midle *Membrane*: The said *String* though for
the greater part, *Parenchymous*, yet being strengthened with the *admixture*
of some *Lignous Fibres*; not otherwise visible in either of these
two *Membranes*. So that they seem, to be a small portion of those
which are inosculated at the bottome of the *Outer Membrane*, and
thence produced through the midlemost, underneath the *Chanel*, till at
last they break forth into the upper *Cistern*, where they form this inner
*Membrane*: a piece of close-wrought *Work*, suitable to the incomparable
fineness of all the *Stuff* out of which it is made.

16. §. The same *Membrane* is originally entire, as the Midlemost:
but being grown to about the bigness of a *Carvi-Seed*, becomes a little
hollow near the *Cone*. And the *Lignous Fibers* abovesaid, *Tab. 81.* fetching their
compass from the *Base*, shoot forth into the *Cone*; and so make a very
small *Node* therein, for the first *Essay* towards the *Generation* of the
*Seed*. The said *Fibers* being thus spun out, to the utmost degree of fineness
for this purpose.

17. §. This *Node*, being grown about ⅕ᵗʰ part as big as a *Cheese-Mite*;
it begins next to be divided by a little indenture at the *Top*. *Tab. 81.*
Which growing by degrees still deeper, the *Node* is hereby at length
distinguished into two *Lobes* or thick *Leavs*.

18. §. So soon as these are finished, their *Basis* begins afterwards
to be contracted, *Tab. 81.* and so to be formed into a *Radicle* or that part of
the *Seed* which becomes the *Root*. As the *Stalks* of *Fruits* do grow
lesser, while the *Fruits* themselves are expanded. So that in this estate,
the *Radicle* is, as it were, the *Stalk* of the *Seed*.

19. §. At this time, the *Seed* being extream small, the *Lobes* are
not so manageable as to be separated one from the other. But it is
most reasonable to suppose that so soon as the *Radicle* is finished, the
next step, is the pushing forth of another *Node*, between the *Lobes*, in
order to the making of a *Bud*, and so the perfection of the *Seed*.

20. §. This being done or in doing, the *Radicle* or *Stalk* of the
*Seed*, containing still more and more at the bottome, hangs at the Inner
*Membrane*, only by an extream small and short *Ligament* or *Navel-String*.
Which at last, also breaks; and so the *Seed*, as *Fruits* when they are
ripe, falls off and lies loose in the Iner *Membrane*; *Tab. 81.* this gradually shrinking
up and so becoming more hollow, to make room for the further
*Growth* of the *Seed*.
