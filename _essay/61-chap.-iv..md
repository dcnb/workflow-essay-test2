### Of the FOETUS or true SEED: and first of the
    RADICLE and LOBES.

![H](images/i_drop_h_019.jpg)
AVING
discoursed of the *Covers*, I come next to
the *Seed* or *Fœtus* it self. Of the *Shape* and *Posture*
whereof, I shall give some *Examples*, first, among
those with the thinner sort of *Covers*; and
then, of those with the *Bulky* one: where I shall
speak only of the *Lobes*, or *Main Body*, and the
*Radicle*. Next, I shall describe the several sorts of
*Nodes* or *Buds* of *Seeds*. And lastly, the several Parts, of which the
*Lobes*, *Radicle*, and *Buds* are compounded.

2. §. Among *Seeds* with the *Thinner Covers*, are those of all sorts of
*Corn* and *Grass*. Of a different make, from that of most other *Seeds*:
The *Main Body* being not divided into *Lobes*, but one entire Piece,
doubled in the form of a Pair of *Lips*. And whereas commonly,
the whole *Seed* is very *Soft* and *Oyly*; here, only those two minute
*Parts*, which become the *Root* and *Stalk*, are so: The *Main Body*
being of a different Substance; when the *Corn* is ripe, *hard* and *friable*;
but when it is sown, easily *colliquable* into a kind of *Milk* or *Chyle*, so
that, in some respects, it hath a near *Analogy* to a *Vitellum*. For as that
is gradually melted into a sort of *Chyle*, and by the *Branches* of the *Ductus
Intestinalis* carryed into the *Bowels* of the *Chick*: So is this, into a
like *Substance*, and by the *Branches* of the *Seminal Root* (formerly
describ’d) conveyed to those *Parts*, which become the future Plant.
 *B. 1. Ch. 1.*

3. §. Of Relation to this Kind, the *Seeds* of *Dates*, and of some
other like *Plants*, may be esteem’d. For that which is commonly called
the *Stone*, seems indeed to be the *Main Body* of the *Seed*, doubled
or folded up in the same manner as in *Corn*. To which that *Part* which
becomes the *Plant*, is annexed. *Tab. 75.* But whereas in *Corn*, ’tis placed at

the Bottom of the *Main Body*; here it lies in a small round *Cavity* in
the middle of the *Back*. The *Stone*, or *Main Body*, where this Part
grows to it, is not so hard, as more remote from it: and is therefore
probably in some part dissolved, by lying in the *Ground*, as in
*Corn*.

4. §. But for the most part, the *Main Body* is divided, as hath been
said, into two *Lobes*; and those in Substance *Homogeneous* to the other
*Part* or *Parts*, plainly distinguished in most *Kernels* and other
large *Seeds*; *Tab. 75.* and not difficultly in many lesser ones, as in that of *Viola
Lunaris*, *Scabious*, *Doves-Foot*, &c. if slipped out of their *Covers* before
they are full ripe.

5. §. In *Hounds-Tongue*, they are of a circular figure, and very large in
Proportion to the *Radicle*. In *Cucumer*, oblong, with some visible
*Branches* of the *Seminal Root*; and the *Radicle* somewhat bigger. *Tab. 75.* But
in *Scorzonera*, very long, like the Leggs of a Pair of *Compasses*: and
the two first, or *dissimilar Leavs* of the *Plant* into which they are
converted, are of the same *Shape*. Of these and many more, the
*Radicle* is short and pointed; and lies in one straight Line with the
*Lobes*.

6. §. In *Viola Lunaria*, they are very large; and the *Branches* of
the *Seminal Root*, fairly apparent, so as to resemble a Pair of *Leavs*.
The *Radicle* pretty long, equally thick from end to end, and couched
down upon the two *Lobes*, *Tab. 75.* each of them having a little *Shoulder* for it
to lie upon. In *Woad*, where it hath the like *Posture* and *Shape*, as also
in *Chamælina*, *Eruca*, and many others, it is very *Bulky*, being bigger
than both the *Lobes* put together.

7. §. Of this Part, I think it may be observed, That commonly those
*Seeds*, wherein it is very small with respect to the *Lobes*, produce a
*Perennial* Plant: And so, *vice versa*, where it is very large, an *Annual*
one. In the latter, the *Seminal Virtue* being more vigorous, and so
tending more hastily to the Business of *Generation*, followed with the
*Death* of the Plant.

8. §. IN THE former *Seeds*, the *Lobes* lie flat one against another.
*Tab. 75.* But in *Garden-Radish*, they are folded up, so as to receive the *Radicle*
into their *Bosome*: as when a *Chicken* tucks his Head under his
Wing.

9. §. In *Holyoak*, the *Lobes* are plated upwards, and re-plated
down again. *Tab. 75.* Being most agreeably composed to the *Shape* of the
*Covers*, as those are to their *Posture* on the Plant. In *Maple*, they are
plated one over another, and so rouled up.

10. §. In the *Cotton-Seed*, which consisteth almost wholly of two very
broad and thin *Lobes* or *Leaves*, the *Folds* are yet more numerous; *Tab. 75.* all
curiously reduced to an exact and solid *Oval*.

11. §. It happens now and then, that instead of two, there are
three *Lobes*, as in the *Kernels* of *Plums*, *Apples*, and other *Fruits*, and
the smaller sorts of *Seeds*, will spring up sometimes with more than
two *dissimilar Leaves*, originally the *Lobes* of the *Seed*. These are observed
by some, more frequently to produce a double *Flower*, which
may be, because the *Seminal Virtue* in such *Seeds*, is increased by a third
Part.

12. §. IN many *Seeds*, the *Radicle* is of one and the same *Colour*
from end to end. But in others, as in the *Lupine*, it is observable,
That the upper and greater half, is *White*; the Lower to the *Point*, hath
a kind of *Horny Gloss*, and seems to be of a somewhat different make. *Tab. 75.*
Whereby it comes to pass, that after the *Radicle* is shot forth a little
way, only this lower half descends and becomes the *Root*: The upper
half is produced or raised above ground, as a *Pillar* upon which the
*Lobes*, or *dissimilar Leaves* are erected.

13. §. This *Seed*, on the out side of each *Lobe*, and near the *Radicle*,
hath a very small and round *Node*, like a *Navel*; whereof, in the
first Book: the whole *Seed* looking not much unlike a *Pidgeons Head*;
 *Ch. 7.*
the *Radicle* resembling the *Bill*, and the *Navel* the *Eye*.

14. §. IN the *Seed* of *Garden-Orach*, *Tab. 75.* both the *Radicle* and *Lobes*
are very long and slender, and lie almost in a compleat Circle round
about the *Vitellum* before describ’d. The *Lobes* of *Rhapontick* are
shaped like the *Bitt* of a *Spade*;
 *Ch. 3.* and the *Radicle* stands erected above
them like the *Handle*.

15. §. OF SEEDS also with the *Bulky Cover*, there are many not
divided into *Lobes*; being in a manner, all one *Piece*; as all of the
*Bulbous-Kind*. In some of which, though the inmost *Cover* be thin;
yet compared either with the other *Covers*, or with the *Seed* it self, it
may very well be accounted of the *Bulky Kind*.

16. §. In *Flag*, it is above twenty times bigger than the *Seed* within
it. Consisting of *Bladders* all *Radiated* towards the *Seat* of the *Seed*.
The *Seed* it self is shaped somewhat like a *Penknife*. *Tab. 76.* The lower Part
which becomes the *Bulb*, as the *Haft*, is thick, and cometh near to a
*Cylindrick* Figure, and the end, round. The upper Part which becomes
the first years *Leaf*, as the *Blade*, is rather flat, double edged, and pointed,
and the Point a little bent. The *Fibers* and *Bladders* of which
it consists, are all disposed into Parallel Lines running by the length.
In *Lily*, where this *Cover* is thinner and more *Transparent*, without being
cut, but only held up against the Light, the *Seed* may be seen within
it.

17. §. BUT THE greater number of *Seeds* also with the *Bulky
Cover*, are divided into two *Lobes*; which, for the most part, resemble
a pair of little *Leavs*. In the *Purging Nut* of *Angola*, the *Shell* being
taken off, the upper *Covers* (dry’d and shrunk up) seem to be but one. *Tab. 76.*
In these, the *Spermatick Vessels* are Branched. Under these, lies the
Thick and Inmost *Cover*; which being cut down the middle, exhibits
the true *Seed*: Consisting of a couple of fair *Leavs*, Veined, and as
white as *Milk*, joyned together with the *Radicle* at their *Base*; and
let into a Hollow, made in the *Cover*, of an answerable shape. The
like is observable in the *Barbado-Nut*, *Ricinus Americanus*, and some
other *Indian Fruits*; with some little difference in the Shape of the
*Root* and *Leavs*.

18. §. IN the foregoing *Fruits*, the *Bulky Cover* is very soft.
But in the *Nux Vomica Officinarum*, ’tis near as hard as a *Date-Stone*. *Tab. 76.*
In this, besides the hollow made for the reception of the *Seed*, or the
two *Leavs* and *Root*; the *Sides* are separated or distinct almost to the
*Edge* of the *Cover* round about, especially towards the *Root*: So that
it may not unaptly be compared to a little *Pouch* with the *Sides* clapt
together.

19. §. IN this and the *Nuts* above mentioned,the *Seeds* are all very
large. But in some other *Plants*, they are extream small, so as to be
hardly visible without a *Glass*; *Tab. 77.* as in *Staphisagria*, *Peony*, &c. In *Staphisagria*,
the *Thick* or *Inmost Cover*, is commonly a *Spherical Triangle*,
*conick* towards the *Base*. At the poynt of which, there is a little *Cavity*,
in which the *Seed*, about as big as a small pins head, is lodged. The
*Root* whereof is a little poynted, and the two *Lobes* rounded at the
*Top*.

20. §. In *Peony*, the same *Cover* is *Soft*, *White*, and of an *Oval Figure*;
*Tab. 77.* the part used in *Medicine*. Usually thought to be the *Seed* it
self. But is near two hundred times biger than the true *Seed*, which is
almost invisible. It lies in a little *Cavity* near the bottom of the *Cover*;
with a thick and blunt *Root*, and two poynted *Lobes* or *Leavs*.

21. §. IN the *Coffee-Berry*, the *Seed* lies in the *Inner* or *Cartilaginous
Cover* (formerly described) *Ch. 3.* where one would not expect to find
it, *sc.* near the *Top* or *Surface* of the *Back*. *Tab. 77.* The *Lobes* of the *Seed* are
veined like two very minute *Leaves*, and joyned to a long *Root* like a
*Stalk*. The end of which comes just to the bottom of the *Cover*, ready
for its *exit* into the *Ground*.

22. §. In *Goosgrass*, where the *Inner Cover* is also *Cartilaginous* or
*Horney*, *Tab. 77.* the *Seed* is postured in much a like manner, and looks just like
a couple of poynted *Leavs* with a very long *Stalk*.

23. §. THE *Seed* of *Stramonium*, is also inclosed in a *Bulky Cover*.
Which being soaked in warm water, and very warily cut about
the edges, with a *Rasor*, the *Seed* may be taken out of it entire. *Tab. 77.* Shaped
like that of *Orach*, but much longer. For the *Reception* whereof, the
*Cover* is formed with a hollow, which runs round about it near the
*Edge*; where in the *Seed* lies like a little winding *Snake*.
