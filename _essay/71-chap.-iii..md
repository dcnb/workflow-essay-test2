### CHAP. III.

### What may be observed of the PARTS of Animals.

![I](images/i_drop_i_145.jpg)

NOW proceed to the several *Parts* of *Animals*; as
    *Hairs*, *Hoofs*, *Horns*, *Shells* and *shelly Insects*, *Bones*,
    *Flesh and the several Viscera*, *Silk*, *Blood*, *Eggs*, *Musk*,
    *Castor*, *Gall*, *Urine*, *Dungs*, *Salts and Stones*.

2. §. *And first of all, the Hair of a mans head,
    with Oyl of Vitriol, maketh no Bullition at all. Nor
    yet with Spirit of Nitre.* So that although it contains
    a good deal of *volatile Salt*; yet it seemeth either not to be *alkaline*,
    or else is *centred* in so great a quantity of *Oyl*, that the *acid menstruum*
    cannot reach it.

3. § *Hares Fur, with spirit of Nitre, maketh, although a short, yet
    very plain Bullition and huff.* Hence the *Hair*, and therefore the *Blood*,
    of some *Animals*, is fuller of *Salt*, at least of an *Alkaline Salt*, than
    that of some others. And perhaps the *Hair* of some men, as of *Black’s*,
    may be so full of *Salt*, as to make a Bullition like *Hares Fur*.

4. §. *The shavings of Nails stir not at all, either with Oyl of Vitriol,
    or Spirit of Nitre: only with the latter they turn yellow. But Elks Claws,
    with Spirit of Nitre, make a small and slow Bullition.*

5. §. *Horses Hoof, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not of many hours. But
    with Spirit of Nitre, allowing it some time, makes a very plain Bullition,
    and huffs up very high.*

6. §. *Cows Horn, neither with Oyl of Vitriol, nor with Spirit of Nitre,
    maketh any Bullition, only turneth a yellow colour.*

7. §. *Rams Horn stirs not with Oyl of Vitriol; but with Spirit of
    Nitre, makes a small and slow Bullition.*

8. §. *Harts-Horn makes a considerable Bullition and huff, even with
    Oyl of Vitriol, which the rest of the Bodies abovesaid, will not do. But
    with Spirit of Nitre, it makes yet a greater.* From the foregoing Experiments,
    and almost all that follow, what is before asserted of
    the *Salts* of *Vegetables* and *Minerals*, is here also evident concerning that
    of *Animals*, *scil.* That it is not *made*, but only *separated* by the fire.
    It likewise hence appears, That the *proportion* of *Salt* in the forementioned
    *parts* is very different; and that therefore some of them are never,
    and none of them but with good discretion, to be substituted one for
    another in Medicine. As also, that there is a different proportion of
    *Salt* in the several *Animals* themselves, to which the said *Parts* belong.

9. §. *Next for shells; as those of Lobsters, Eggs, Snails and Oisters:
    all which make an Effervescence, both with Oyl of Vitriol, and Spirit of
    Nitre. But with Spirit of Nitre the greatest. Lobster-shells make a considerable
    Bullition and huff, but no noise nor steams. Egg-shells make a Bullition and
    huff, with some noise, but no steams. Snail-shells make an Effervescence
    with noise and steams. Oyster-shells make one with the gratest noise and
    thickest steams.* Hence we may judge, in what case to administer *one*
    more appositely than *another*. As also *in what proportion*, according to
    their different strength. Some may be better for *Children*, as being
    milder. Or for a Body whose very sharp *Blood* or other *Humors*, are
    more easily kindled into *Ferments*. Or else may be safest, to avoid a
    sudden *precipitation* of the *Humors*; or for some other cause.

10. §. *Oyster-shells, and the rest above-said, make a quicker Effervescence,
    not only with Spirit of Nitre, but even with Spirit of Salt, than
    they do with Oyl of Sulphur, or Oyl of Vitriol.* So that *these bodies*, as
    well as *Metals*, have their proper *Menstruums* whereby they are be
    dissolved.

11. §. *Egg-shells calcined, make with Oyl of Sulphur, or Oyl of Vitriol,
    or Spirit of Nitre, a greater Effervescence, than when uncalcined.
    As also with steams, which uncalcined, they produce not. The like is
    seen in calcined Oyster-shells. And the longer the Calcination is continued,
    the quicker and stronger will be the Effervescence. This I tryed at several
    terms, from a quarter of an hour, to five hours. So that after so long a
    Calcination, they make an Effervescence almost instantaneous.* The reason
    hereof is, Because the several *Principles* whereof the *Shells* consist, being
    relaxed, and the *Sulphur* for the greatest part, driven away by the fire;
    the remaining *Salt* lies now more open and naked to the attaque of the
    *Menstruum*, so soon as ever they are mixed together. From hence it is
    plain, That *Egg-shells*, and the others above-said, being *burnt*, are far
    *stronger* Medicines, than when *unburnt*. It is hereby likewise evident,
    That a great portion of their *Salt*, is not a *volatile*, but a *fixed Alkaly*.
    To these may be subjoyned all kinds of shelly *Insects*. I will instance
    in three or four.

12. §. *And first Bees, with Oyl of Vitriol, stir not in the least. With
    Spirit of Nitre they make an exceeding small Bullition, without any elevation.*

13. §. *Cochinele* (the *Nest* of an *Insect*) *makes some Bullition with
    Oyl of Vitriol, but very small: for the bubbles are not to be seen without a
    Glass. But with Spirit of Nitre the Bullition is more visible, and joyned
    with some elevation.*

14. §. *Cantharides make no visible Bullition with Oyl of Vitriol.
    But with Spirit of Nitre they do, and huff up rather more than Cochinele.
    Yet is this done very slowly, and comparatively with many other
    bodies, is not much.* Hence it is not the *quantity*, but the *quality*
    of their *volatile Salt*, which makes them so strong an *Epispastick*.
    For most of those Bodies above, and hereafter named, make a
    greater *Bullition*, and yet are neither *Caustick* nor *Epispastick* in the
    least. It is hence also evident, as hath been before suggested, That
    there are divers kinds of *Volatile Salts*, eminently different; some
    being highly *alkaline*, others very *little*, and some scarce any thing
    so: such as those of *Scurvy-grass*, *Anemone*, *Crowfoot*, and many the
    like *Plants*; to whose *Salts*, this of *Cantharides* seemeth to be very
    near of kin.

15. §. *Millepedes make a Bullition and huff, much greater and quicker,
    than any of the Insects above-named: and that both with Spirit of Nitre,
    and Oyl of Vitriol it self. Yet is this Insect of a very temperate nature.*
    Whereby is further demonstrated, That the being *simply alkaline*, is not
    enough to make a body to be *Caustick*.

16. §. *Again, although Millepedes make a Bullition, greater than any
    of the Insects above named: yet is it much less, than that of Oyster, Snail,
    or even Egg-shells; and of divers other bodies above, and hereafter mentioned.*
    Hence, being given to the same intent, as any of those bodies;
    it is the mildest and gentlest in its operation of them all.

17. §. *Millepedes likewise calcined, makes a stronger Effervescence,
    than when uncalcined, as do the Oyster-shells, &c.* So that it appears,
    That *all Testaceous Salts*, are at least in part, *fixed Salts*.

18. §. *I next proceed to Bones. And first Whale-bone maketh no
    Bullition at all with any acid. A Cartilage, with Spirit of Nitre, makes
    some very small bubbles, not to be seen without a Glass.*

19. §. *The Bone in the Throat of a Carp, makes a little and slow Bullition
    with Spirit of Nitre. The Spina of a Fish (that which I used was of
    a Cod-fish) maketh a Bullition one degree higher.*

20. §. *All sorts of Teeth, as Dogs, Boars, the Sea-horse, Elephant,
    make the like. As also the Bone of an Oxes heart.* So that all these are
    very gentle in their operation, and fit for *Children*.

21. §. *Sheeps and Calves Bones both of them make a Bullition yet a
    little higher, especially with Spirit of Nitre. Cocks Bones somewhat higher
    than the former. Cranium humanum a little higher than all the rest.*

22. §. *Bones likewise, being calcined, make a Bullition with Acids.
    And so doth also calcined Harts-Horn. But in neither of them, is the Bullition
    advanced by Calcination, any thing comparable to what it is in shells.*
    Whence it appears, That the *Salt* of *Horns* and *Bones*, is much more
    *volatile*, than that of *Shells*.

23. §. *Next for Flesh and the several Viscera. And first, dryed
    and powdered Mutton, with Oil of Vitriol, stirs not at all. But with
    Spirit of Nitre makes a small Bullition and huff. Sheeps Heart doth the
    like somewhat more apparently. Vipers flesh produceth a froth, but huffs
    not, Powdered Earthsworms make a great froth, and huff a little. Powdered
    Tripe makes only a little Bullition. Lamb-stones do the like. Kidney,
    Spleen, and Liver, with some elevation. Lungs, with bubbles very
    large; because extraordinary slowly. Dryed Brain makes also a little*

    *and slow Bullition.* Hence there is a greater proportion of *Sulphur*
    or *Oyl*, and less of *an Alkaly in all these parts*, than there is in *Bones*,
    *Shells*, and divers other *parts* hereafter mentioned. And in some of
    them, as in the *Brain*, that *Alkaline Salt* which there is, may rather be
    lodged in some *sanguineous* parts mixed with them, than in their own
    proper substance.

24. §. I proceed to instance in all sorts of Animal *Contents*. *And
    first, raw Silk, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very small Bullition, but
    the elevation is considerable.*

25. §. *The grumous part of the Blood dryed, with Oyl of Vitriol,
    stirs but little. But with Spirit of Nitre it huffs up considerably.*

26. §. *Serum of Blood dryed, with the same Spirit makes a plain
    elevation, with a little Bullition. Herewith may be reckoned the White
    of an Egg, which is nothing but a pure Crystlalline Serum separated from the
    common stock. This being dryed, with Spirit of Nitre, huffs up rather
    more than even the grumous part of the Blood, the Bubbles are much larger,
    break oftner, and the elevation sooner made.* Whence it seemeth, that
    there is a greater quantity of a *volatile Alkaly* in proportion to the
    *Sulphur*, requisite to the *Generation*, than to the *Nutrition* of an
    *Animal*.

27. §. *The Yelk of an Egg is scarce moved with spirit of Nitre, producing
    only a very few Bubbles.* The *Salt* being either little *alkalizate*,
    or else *immersed* in so great a quantity of *Oyl*, that the *Menstruum* cannot
    reach it. *For the same reason Sperma Ceti stirs not with any Acid.
    Neither doth Civet.*

28. §. *Russian Castor, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not. But with
    Spirit of Nitre makes a considerable huff and froth. Yet it requires time.*
    Wherefore it seemeth, That *Castor* by virtue of its *alkaline sulphur*,
    becomes so good a *Corrector* of the *acid-alkaline sulphur* of *Opium*; so
    I take leave to call it, having some reasons to believe it such.

29. §. *Musk, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not. But with Spirit of
    Nitre it makes a considerable and quick Bullition, with large bubbles,
    which often break and rise again.* Whence there is a very eminent difference
    betwixt *Musk* and *Civet*. Hence also, *Musk* is Cordial, not
    only from its *Sulphur*, but its *Alkaly*; by both directly opposite to preternatural
    *Acidities*.

30. §. *Dryed Gall with Spirit of Nitre, for some time, is still: but
    at length it makes a considerable Bullition and froth.* The reason why
    it is so long before it begins, is because the *Salt*, (as was observed of
    some other *Parts*) is locked up in so great a quantity of *Oyl*. The
    abundance whereof is manifest, not only from *Destillation*, but also
    from hence, In that the dryed *Powder*, in lying by, incorporateth all
    together into one body, as *Mirrh*, and some other softer and oily *Gums*
    are used to do.

31. §. *Extract of Urine, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a Bullition
    with some Effervescence, which continues for a considerable time; and at
    last it huffs up with great bubbles. The Bullition begins presently: the
    Salt being copious, and the Oyl but little.*

32. §. *The same Extract of Urine makes a considerable Bullition and
    froth, not only with Spirit of Nitre, but even with Oyl of Vitriol.* Hence
    the *Salt* of *Urine* is more *alkaline* than that in most of the afore-said

    *Contents*. From this and some of the following *Experiments*, it also appears,
    That the *Salt* which concurs to the generation of *Gravel* or of
    a *Stone* in the *Kidneys* or *Bladder*, is of a very different nature from the
    *Salt* of *Urine*.

33. §. *Next for Dungs. And first, dryed Goats-dung makes with
    Spirit of Nitre, a small Bullition, but no elevation. That of Mice the
    like. And that of Cows. So that of all I have tryed, these three stir the
    least.*

34. §. *Goose-dung, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very small Bullition
    and some elevation. But it requires time. Oyl of Vitriol stirs it
    not.*

35. §. *Album Græcum, with Spirit of Nitre, besides innumerable
    small bubbles, rises up with some great ones, exactly resembling the huffing
    up of Yest or Barm. Also with Oyl of Vitriol it maketh some little froth,
    but slowly.* So that it should seem, that the *Bones* are a little *opened* by
    some *acid Menstruum* in the Dogs stomach (as the body of *Steel* is in its
    preparation with *Sulphur*) whereby it becomes a good mild *Topick* in
    *Quinzies*.

36. §. *Hens dung, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very great bullition
    and huff: greater and quicker, than any of the rest above-named.*

37. §. *But of all I have tryed, Pigeons dung, with the same Spirit,
    maketh the greatest and the quickest Effervescence and huff; and that not
    without steams. Yet neither the same Dung, nor that of Hens, is moved
    in the least with Oyl of Vitriol.* The Cause of so great an *Effervescence*
    in these, more than in the rest, is that *white part* which is here mixed
    in a great quantity with the *Dung*. Which *white part*, descendeth
    not from the *Stomach*, but is an *Excrement* separated from the *Blood*
    (as the *Urine* in other *Animals*) by a peculiar *Organ*, which evacuates
    it into the *Intestinum rectum*; whence, together with the *Stercus* it is
    excluded. Hence it is evident, That in the said *white part* of *Hens*,
    and especially *Pigeons dung*, is contained a great quantity of a *volatile
    Alkaly*.

38. §. *I proceed to Salts. And first Salt of Blood and Urine both
    make a more durable Effervescence with Acids, than doth Salt of Wormwood,
    or Salt of Fern.* Hence the former are more *alkaline*, than
    the latter.

39. §. *Again, though divers other Animal Salts will not stir with
    Spirit of Salt, or with Oyl of Sulphur or Vitriol; yet the Salt of Blood
    will make an Effervescence with all kinds of Acids.* Whence it is further
    argued to be highly *alkaline*, and very proper for the *correction*, of
    all sorts of *preternatural Acids* in the body. There is little doubt, but
    that *Spirit* of *Harts-horn* will do the like.

40. §. *The Gravel which is precipitated out of Urine; with Oyl of
    Vitriol makes no bullition in the least. Nor with strong Spirit of Salt. But
    with Spirit of Nitre, it makes a very great one, with Effervescence and
    steams.* From hence it appears, That there is much difference to be
    made in the use of *acid Diureticks*, *Nephriticks*, &c.

41. §. And that I may not altogether omit to mention, what may
    be so much for the good of mankind, I do here declare, That for preventing
    (I say not, the breaking, but preventing) the generation of
    the *Stone*, either in the *Kidneys*, or in the *Bladder*, there are not better

    *Medicines* in the world, than some certain *Preparations* of *Nitre*,
    duly administred. Whoever shall think that any kind of *acid*, as *Oyl
    of Sulphur*, *Oyl of Vitriol*, *Spirit of Salt*, or the like, will have the same
    effects, will find themselves much deceived in their practice.

42. §. *I conclude with Stones. And first, Spirit of Nitre droped upon
    a Stone of the Kidneys or Bladder, produceth the very same effect, as
    upon the Gravel in Urine. That is to say, it makes it boil and huff up,
    until at length it is perfectly dissolved into a soft Pulp; which neither Oyl
    of Sulphur, nor Oyl of Vitriol, nor Spirit of Salt will do; nor give the least
    touch towards its dissolution.* This confirms what said before of the
    use of *Nitre* and *Nitrous Spirits*, if duly prepared and administred, above
    any other *Acids*, against the breeding of the *Stone*.

43. §. *Pearls, with any Acid, make the like Effervescence, as do Oyster-shells.
    But Magistery of Pearls, as usually prepared, stirs not at all,
    with any Alkaly or Acid.* So that as to the effect frequently intended by
    it, it is very insignificant; as of that of *Corals* hath been said.

44. §. *Crabs Eyes, with any Acid, make an Effervescence, almost as
    quick as that of Oyster-shells.*

45. §. *Crabs Eyes likewise calcined, make a stronger Effervescence, than
    when uncalcined.* So that *these*, as well as *Shells*, contain a *fixed
    Alkaly*.

46. §. *The Stones in Whitings heads make a strong Effervescence
    like that of Oyster-shells.*

47. §. *Stone of humane Gall, Stirs not with Oyl of Vitriol. But with
    Spirit of Nitre maketh a little bullition just upon mixing, and after a considerable
    time, a little froth. Much less than what was observed before of
    the Gall it self.* So that it seemeth to be generated of the *Gall coagulated*
    by some *Acid*, which hath already *refracted* the *Alkaly* wherewith
    the *Gall* abounds. This confirms the use of those *Medicines* in the *Jaundies*,
    or any other bordering *Disease*, which destroys those *Acidities*
    by which the *Gall* is *curdled* or *coagulated*, and so rendred more
    difficulty separable into the *Guts*.

48. §. Since the first publishing of these Observations, Mr. *William
    Matthews* an *Apothecary* in *Ledbury*, sent me part, as I take it, of a
    *Stomach-stone*, as big as a *Wallnut* of the largest Size, voided by a woman
    about 82 years of age, sometime after an *Autumn Fever*. It consisteth
    of the same *Striæ*, as the *Bezoar Stone*; and maketh some *Bullition*
    with *Spirit* of *Nitre*.

49. §. *Bezoar, neither the Western nor the Eastern, doth stir at all
    with Oyl of Vitriol.*

50. §. *Western Bezoar, with Spirit of Nitre, makes a very little thin
    froth, and that’s all; and that it doth very slowly. But Oriental Bezoar,
    with Spirit of Nitre, after some time, maketh a very great Effervescence,
    froth, elevation, noise, and steams (as if you poured Oyl of Vitriol upon Salt
    of Tartar) till it be wholly dissolved by the affused Spirit, and turned into
    almost a blood-red.* Hence it may seem to be no mean *Remedy* against
    such *fretting* and *venenate acids*, as oftentimes in *Fevers*, and other *Distempers*,
    lye about the *Stomach*, and are thence frequently translated
    to the *Heart*, *Brain*, *Nerves*, and other *parts*. The difference likewise
    betwixt the *Western* and the *Eastern Bezoar*, is so great, that in any
    case of danger, and where the *Bezoar* is relyed upon, it is an unpardonable

    fault, for the *Apothecary*, or any *Person*, to *substitute* the one for
    the other: unless he will take *ten times* as much, or *ten times* as little
    of the one, as he would have done of the other: if that will serve turn.

51. §. The *Stones* already mentioned, (except the great *Stomach-stone*)
    are ordinarily generated in the bodies of *Animals*. I have one
    Instance more of some other *Stones* which are extraordinary. In the
    City of *Hereford* lives a Maid, who often voids these *Stones*, and in
    the space of some years last past, hath voided several pounds, of several
    *Colours* and *Sizes*, not only *per vias urinarias*, but also by vomit,
    and by stool. The first mention made to me of them, was by
    Mr. *Diggs*, a worthy Gentleman of that City, as a thing that was there
    much wondred at. And some of them, upon my desire, were sent
    me by Mr. *Wellington*, an Apothecary in the same place. *I have
    tryed what several acid Menstruums will work upon them; and find, That
    with Oyl of Vitriol, and especially with Spirit of Nitre the great ones make
    a very quick and conspicuous Effervescence. But the small ones, neither
    the white, nor the grey, make any Bullition in the least:* for in truth, they
    are no other but little *Pebbles* and *Grit-stones*.

52. §. This being considerd, and the various *colours* and *mixture*
    of any one of the great *Stones*, being well observed; it seemeth plain,
    That although she be somewhat old (above thirty years) yet may she
    have a kind of μαλακία, or *diseased Appetite* to *Stones*, *Bones*, *Wood-ashes*,
    *Tobacco-Pipes*, *Chalk*, and such like things; which sometimes
    swallowing in little *lumps*, sometimes grosly, or finely ground betwixt
    her teeth; they are in her *Stomach* and *Bowels*, more or fewer of them,
    *cemented* together, either with a *pituitous*, *bilious*, or some other more
    or less *glutinous substance*. And that by virtue also of the said *Cement*,
    or any of the said, or other like *alkalizate Bodies*, the greater *Stones*,
    which consist of those partly, do make an *Effervescence* with *acid Liquors*.
    Thus far of *Instances* upon the *parts* of *Animals*. I shall close
    with some *Corollaries* deduced from the whole.

53. §. And first, since we find, that amongst all the *Menstruums* we
    have made use of, *Spirit* of *Nitre*, or any very *Nitrous Spirit*, is the
    most *universal dissolver* of all kinds of *Animal Bodies*; the *best dissolver*
    of many others both *Vegetable* and *Mineral*, and the *only dissolver*
    of some: Hence it is probable, That the great *stomachick Menstruum*,
    which either *dissolves*, or *opens* almost all *Bodies* which come into the
    *Stomach*, is a kind of *Nitrous Spirit*.

54. §. Again, *Spirit* of *Nitre* being a *subalkaline Acid*, and working
    more evidently upon *Animal bodies*, than other *simpler Acids* do,
    which yet are as *strong*; It hence follows, That most of the *Salts* of
    *Animals* are *subacid Alkalies*. How far this *conclusion* may further instruct
    us, I shall have occasion to shew in another *Discourse*.

55. §. Lastly, there being so many, say twenty or thirty *degrees*,
    from the *slowest* to the most *vehement*, in the *Bullition* of *mixed Bodies*;
    it seemeth, That *Fermentation* it self, as to the *formal notion* of it, is

    nothing else: or that from the common *Luctation* of *mixed Bodies*
    whereof we have now been speaking, it differs not *in specie*, but only
    in the manner of its *causation*, and in *degree*: the *Aer*, or some certain
    *Menstruum* lodged therein, being of no greater *strength*, than to
    produce a *Bullition* or *Luctation* of that *low* and *soft degree*, which we
    call *Fermentation*.

56. §. I have thus endeavoured to prove, by various *Instances*,
    how instructive this most easie, plain and simple *Method* in the *Mixture*
    of *Bodies*, may become to us: and that meerly by observing the *Luctations*
    which thence arise betwixt them. How much more then, if a
    diligent remarque be made of all those various *Colours*, *Smells*, *Tastes*,
    *Consistencies*, and other *Mutations* thereupon emergent?
