### Of the COLOURS of Plants in their Natural
    Estate.

AVING
 formerly made some *Observations* of
the *Colours* of *Plants*;
 *Idea, §. 27.* and *Anat.* of *R. P. 2. §. 65,* &c.
 I shall now crave leave to
add some more to them of the like *Nature*. None
of which, nor any of the *Conclusions* thence deduced,
will, if duly considered, appear contrary to
the *Hypothesis* and *Experiments* of Mr. *Boyle*, Mr.
*Des Cartes*, Mr. *Hook*, Mr. *Newton*, or any other,
concerning *Colours*. As not having respect to
the *Colours* of all *Bodies* in general. Nor to the *Body* of *Colour*,
which is *Light*; Nor to the formal notion of *Colours* (*ad extra*) as the
*Rays* of *Light* are moved or mixed: But to those *Materials*, which are
principally necessary to their *Production* in *Plants*. Concerning which,
the present *Discourse* shall be reduced to these Three general *Heads*,
*scil.*

2. §. *First*, Of those several *Colours*, which appear in *Plants* in their
*Natural Estate*.

3. §. *Secondly*, As they appear upon the *Infusion* of *Plants* into
several Sorts of *Liquors*.

4. §. *Thirdly*, As upon the *Mixture* of those *Infusions*, or of any
one of them with some other *Liquor*, or other *Body*.

5. §. As they appear in the *Plants* themselves, it may be observed
in the first place, That there is a far less variety in the *Colours* of *Roots*,
than of the other *Parts*: the *Parenchyma* being, within the *Skin*, usually
*White*, sometimes *Yellow*, rarely *Red*. The *Cause* hereof being,
for that they are kept, by the *Earth*, from a free and open *Aer*; which
concurreth with the *Juyces* of the several *Parts*, to the *Production* of
their several *Colours*. And therefore the upper parts of *Roots*, when
they happen to stand naked above the Ground, are often deyed with
several *Colours*: so the tops of *Sorrel Roots* will turn *Red*, those of *Mullen*,
*Turneps* and *Radishes*, will turn *purple*, and many others *green*.
Whereas those parts of the same *Roots* which lie more under Ground,
are commonly *White*.

6. §. As *Roots* are more commonly *White*; so the *Leaves*, *Green*.
Which *Colour* is so proper to them, that many *Leaves*, as those of *Sage*,
the young *Sprouts* of St. *Johns-wort*, and others, which are *Redish*
when in the *Bud*; upon their full *Growth*, acquire a perfect *Green*.

7. §. The *Cause* of this *Colour*, is the *action* of the *Aer*, both from
within, and from without the *Plant*, upon the *Juyces* thereof, whereby
it strikes them into that *Colour*.

8. §. By the *Aer* from without, I mean that which surrounds the
*Body* of the *Plant*: which is the Cause of its *Greeness*, not meerly as
it is contiguous to it, but as it penetrates through the *Pores* of the
*Skin*, thereinto; and so mixing with the *Juyces* thereof, plainly deys
or strikes them into a *Green*.

9. §. By the *Aer* from within, I mean, that which entring, together
with the *Aliment*, at the *Root*, thence ascends by the *Aer-Vessels*,
into the *Trunk* and *Leaves*, and is there transfused into all the several
*Juyces*, thereby likewise concurring to their *Verdure*. Whence it is, that
the *Parts* of *Plants* which lie under *Water*, are *Green*, as well as those
which stand above it; because, though the ambient *Aer*, conteined in
the *Water* be but little, yet the want of it is compensated, by that
which ascends from the *Root*.

10. §. And therefore it is observable, that the *Stalks* of *Marsh-Mallow*,
and some other *Plants*, being cut transversly, though the
*Parenchyma* in the *Barque* be *white*, yet the *Sap-Vessels* which lie within
that *Parenchyma*, are as *Green* as the *Skin* it self; *scil.* because they
stand close to the *Aer-Vessels*. The *Parenchyma*, I say, which is intercepted
from the *Aer*, without, by the *Skin*; and from the *Aer* within,
by the *Sap Vessels*, is *white*: but the *Skin*, which is exposed to the *Aer*
without, and the *Sap-Vessels* which are next neighbours to that within,
are both equally *Green*. So likewise if a *Carrot* be plucked up, and
suffered to lie sometime in the open *Aer*; that part which standeth in
and near the *Centre*, amongst the *Aer-Vessels*, will become *Green* as well
as the *Skin*, all the other *Parts* continuing of a *Redish Yellow*, as before.
The *Aer* therefore, both from without, and from within the *Plant*, together
with the *Juyces* of the *Plant*, are all the concurrent *Causes* of its
*Verdure*.

11. §. BUT how doth the *Aer* concur to the *Greeness* of *Plants*?
I answer; Not as it is meerly either *cold* or *dry*, or *moist*, nor yet *quatenus
Aer*; but as it is a mixed, and particularly, a *Saline Body*: that
is, as there is a considerable quantity of *Saline Parts* mixed with those
which are properly *Aereal*. It being plain from manifold Experience;
That the several kinds of *Salts*, are the grand *Agents* in the *Variation* of
*Colours*. So that, to speak strictly, although *Sulphur* be indeed the
*Female*, or *Materia substrata*, of all *Colours*; yet *Salt* is the *Male* or
*Prime Agent*, by which the *Sulphur* is determined to the *Production* of
one *Colour*, and not of another.

12. §. If then it be the *Aer* mixed with the *Juyces* of a *Plant*, and
the *Salt* of the *Aer*, that makes it *Green*; It may further be asked, what
kind of *Salt*? But this is more hard to judge of. Yet it seemeth, that
it is not an *Acid*, but a *Subalkaline Salt*; or at least some *Salt* which
is different from a simple *Acid*, and hath an *Affinity* with *Alkalies*.

13. §. One reason why I so judge, is, Because that although all
*Plants* yield an *Alkaly*, or other *Salt* different from an *Acid*, and some
in good quantity; yet in most *Plants*, the *Prædominant Principle* is
an *Acid*. So that the *Supply* of an *Acid Principle* from the *Aer*, for
the *Production* of a *Green Colour*, as it would be superfluous; So also
ineffectual: a different *Principle* being requisite to the striking of this,
together with the *Sulphur*, into a *Green Colour*.

14. §. I suppose therefore, That not only *Green*, but all the *Colours*
of *Plants*, are a kind of *Precipitate*, resulting from the concurrence
of the *Saline Parts* of the *Aer*, with the *Saline* and *Sulphurious
Parts* of the *Plant*; and that the *Subalkaline*, or other like *Saline Part*
of the *Aer*, is concurrent with the *Acid* and *Sulphurious Parts* of *Plants*,
for the *Production* of their *Verdure*; that is, as they strike altogether
into a *Green Precipitate*. Which also seemeth to be confirmed by divers
*Experiments* hereafter mentioned.

15. §. THE *Colours* of *Flowers* are various; differing therein not
only from the *Leaf*, but one from another. Yet all seem to depend
upon the general *Causes* aforesaid. And therefore the *Colours* of *Flowers*,
as well as of *Leaves*, to result not solely from the *Contents* of the *Plant*,
but from the concurrence likewise of the *ambient Aer*. Hence it is,
that as they gradually open, and are exposed to the *Aer*, they still either
acquire, or change their *Colour*: no *Flower* having its proper *Colour* in
the *Bud*, (though it be then perfectly formed) but only when it is
expanded. So the *Purple Flower* of *Stock-July Flowers*, while they
are in the *Bud*, are *white*, or *pale*. So *Batchelors Buttons*, *Blew Bottle*,
*Poppy*, *Red Daisies*, and many others, though of divers *Colours*
when blown, yet are all *white* in the *Bud*. And many *Flowers* do
thus change their *Colours* thrice successively; as the youngest *Buds* of
*Ladys-Lookinglass*, *Bugloss* and the like, are all white, the larger *Buds*
are *purple* or *murrey*, and the open *Flowers*, *blew*: according as they
come still neerer, and are longer exposed, to the *Aer*.

16. §. But if the *Colour* of the *Flower* dependeth on the *ambient
Aer*; it may be asked: How it comes to pass then, that this *Colour* is
various, and not one, and that one, a *Green*? that is to say that all
*Flowers* are not *Green*, as well as the *Leaves*? In answer to this Three
things are to be premised.

17. §. *First*, What was said before, is to be remembred, that here
the *Aer* is not a solitary, but concurrent *Cause*. So that besides the
*Efficacy* of this, we are to consider that of the several parts of the *Plant*,
by which the *Contents* both *Aereal* and *Liquid* are supplied to the
*Flower*.

18. §. *Secondly*, That in the *Lymphæducts* of a *Plant*, *Sulphur* is
the *predominant Principle*, and much more abounding than in any other
*part* of a *Plant*, as also hath been formerly shewed.

19. §. *Thirdly*, That it appears, according to what we have observed
in the *Anatomy* of the *Flower*, That the quantity of *Lymphæducts* with
respect to the *Aer-Vessels* is greater in the *Flower* than in the *Leaf*.

20. §. It seemeth therefore, that the *Aer-Vessels*, and therefore the
*Aer*, being *predominant* in the *Leaf*; *Green*, is therein also the *predominant
Colour*. I say *predominant*, because there are other *Colours*
lye vailed under the *Green*, even in the *Leafe*, as will hereafter appear
more manifest.

21. §. On the contrary, the *Lymphæducts*, and therefore the *Sulphur*,
being more, and the *Aer-Vessels* and therefore the *Aer*, less, in
the *Flower* than in the *Leaf*; the *ambient Aer* alone is not able to controle
the *Sulphur* so far, but that it generally carrys the greatest port
in the *Production* of the *Colour*. Yet in different degrees; For if
the proportion betwixt the *Lymphæducts* and the *Aer-Vessels* be more
equal, the *Flower* is either *White* or else *Yellow*, which latter *Colour* is
the next of kin to a *Green*. If the *Sulphur* be somewhat *predominant*,
the *Flower* will shew it self *Red* at first; but the *ambient Aer* hath so
much power upon it, as gradually to turn the *Red* into a *Blew*. But
if the *Sulphur* be much *predominant*, then the *Acid* of the *ambient Aer*
will heighten it to a fixed *Red*.

22. §. Hence it is, that *Yellows* and *Greens* are less alterable, upon
the drying of *Plants* than other *Colours*; *sc.* Because the *Aer* being *predominant*
in their *Production*, they are the less lyable to suffer from it
afterwards. Whereas *Reds* and *Purples*, in the *Production* whereof
*Sulphur* is *predominant*, are very changeable. So the *Red* Flowers of
*Lysimachia*, upon drying, turn *Purple*, and the young *purple Flowers* of
*Bugloss* turn *Blew*. So likewise the *Purple* of *Bilberries*, and the *Crimson*
of baked *Damascens*, both turn *Blew*. For being gathered, and so wanting
a continued supply of fresh *Sulphur*, to bear up the *Colour* against
the force of the *Aer*; it strikes it down at last from *Red* to *Purple* or
*Blew*. I conclude therefore, that one *Principal Cause* of the *Variety* of
*Colours* in the *Flower*, is the over proportion of the *Lympheducts* to
the *Aer-Vessels*, and therefore the dominion of the *Sulphur* over the
*Aer*, therein.

23. §. If it be objected, that the *Aer* doth not deepen, but highten
the *Colour* of the *Blood*: I answer, *First*, That I am not now speaking
of *Animal*, but of *Vegetable Bodies*; the same *Aer* which hightens the *Colour*
of *Blood* one way, may deepen that of a *Flower*, another: nay and
may highten that of some *Flowers* too, some other way.

24. §. And therefore, *Secondly*, it is to be considered, That as
there is not one only, but divers *Saline Principles* in the *Aer*; so are
there also in the several *Parts* of one *Plant*; as in the *Root*, of one sort;
in the *Leavs*, of another; in the *Flower*, of another; and so in the
other *Parts*. For since the *Figuration* of the *Parts* of a *Plant* dependeth

chiefly upon the *Saline Principles*: and that the *Flower* hath a different
*Figure* from that of the *Leaf*: it follows, that there is some *Saline
Principle* in the one, which is not in the other, especially, all in such
*Flowers*, whose *Figures* are cut out by a greater *Variety* and *Complication*
of *Lines*. The *Leavs* therefore, though variously shaped, yet agreeing
so far in one common *Figure*, as usualy to be *flat*; it therefore seemeth
plain, that there is a *Saline Principle* in them all, so far *one*, as to be the
chief *Cause* of that common *Figure*: and in concurrence with the *ambient
Aer*, to be likewise the chief *Cause* of one common *Colour*, *sc.* a *Green*.

25. §. Whereas the *Figure* of the *Flowers*, and therefore their
*Saline Principle*, being more various, and commonly distinct from that
of the *Leaf*; it will easily concur with as a great *Variety* of *Salts* in
the *Aer*, whether *Acid*, *Alkaline*, *Nitrous*, *Urinous*, *Armoniacal*, or
any other therein existent, to the *Precipitation* of the *Sulphur* into
the like *Variety* of *Colours*. Thus far of the *Colours* of *Plants* as they
appear in their *Natural Estate*.
