### CHAP. II.

### Of the Motion and Course of the Aer.

![T](images/i_drop_t_148.jpg)
HE
NEXT enquiry to be made, is, into the
*Motion* and *Course* of the *Aer*. Where this
question will first of all be asked; *sc.* Which way
the *Aer* first *enters* the *Plant*; whether at the
*Trunk*, *Leaves*, and other *Parts* above ground;
or at the *Root*? *I* answer, *That it enters in part,
at them all*. For the *Reception*, as well as *Extramission*
whereof, the *Pores* are so very large, in
the *Trunks* of some *Plants*, as in the better sort
of thick walking *Canes*, that they are visible, to a good Eye, without
a *Glass*; *Tab. 19.* but with a *Glass*, the *Cane* seems, as if it were stuck top
full of holes with great *Pins*: being so large, as very well to resemble
the *Pores* of the *Skin* in the end of the *Fingers* and *Ball* of the
*Hand*.

2. §. In the *Leaves* of *Pine*, they are likewise through a *Glass*, a
very Elegant Show; standing all most exactly, in *rank* and *file*,
throughout the length of the *Leaves*. The *Figure* whereof shall be
given hereafter, when we come to the *Anatomy* of the *Leaf*.

3. §. But although the *Aer* enters, in part, at the *Trunk* and other
*Parts*, especially in some *Plants*; yet its *chief* entrance, is at the
*Root*. Even as some Parts of *Aer*, may continually pass into the *Body*
and *Blood*, by the *Habit*, or *Pores* of the *Skin*; but the chief entrance
hereof, is at the *Mouth*. And what the *Mouth* is, to an *Animal*; that
the *Root* is to a *Plant*.

4. §. Again, if the chief entrance of the *Aer*, were at the *Trunk*; then,
before it could be mixed with the *Sap* in the *Root*, it must descend;
and so move not only contrary to its own Nature, but likewise in a
contrary Course to the *Sap*, throughout the *Plant*. Whereas, by its
*Reception* at the *Root*, and so its *Transition* from thence; it hath a more
natural and easie motion of Ascent. For while the *Sap* ascends, that
the *Aer*, in the same *Plant*, should continually descend, cannot reasonably
be supposed.

5. §. The same is further argued, From the fewness and smallness
of the *Diametral Portions* in the *Trunk* in comparison with those
in the *Root*. In which *Nature* hath plainly designed the same, for the
*Separation* of the *Aer* from the *Sap*, after they are both together received
thereinto. So that the *Reception* and *Course* of the *Aer*, is made on this
manner following.

6. §. THE *Aer* being a *Springy* Body, it insinuates into all the
*Holes* and *Cranies* of the *Earth*; and so is plentifully mixed therewith.
Whereupon, as the *Sap* enters the *Root*, more or less *Aer* still intrudes
it self together with it. The *Liquid* Portion of the *Sap*, swells and
fills up the *Succulent Parts* of the *Barque*. The *Aery* Part, is, as was
said, separated from the *Liquid*, into the *Diametral* Portions. Which

running from the *Barque* towards the Centre of the *Root*, and so passing
along betwixt the *Aer-Vessels*; do hereby convey the *Aery* Part
of the *Sap* from the *Barque*, into the same.

7. §. Being thus received into the *Aer-Vessels*, and the *Reception*
thereof, by the same means continued; it is by them advanced into
the *Trunk*. In which advance, it is again, more or less, disbursed into
all the *Parts* of the *Trunk*, as it goes. *Partly*, inwards to the *Pith*.
From whence, the *Pith* is always, at length, filled with *Aer*. *Partly*,
into the *Insertions*; by which it is conveyed outward into the *Barque*.
Wherein, it is in some part, transfused through the *Sap*: and so the
rest, with part of the *Sap*, remitted, in *perspirations*, back again into
the *Aer*.

8. §. So that, whereas the *Diametral Portions* in the *Root*, do
serve to convey the *Aer* from the *Sap* in the *Barque*, into the *Aer-Vessels*,
in the *Wood*: on the contrary, the *Insertions* here in the
*Trunk*, serve to convey the *Aer* from the *Aer-Vessels* in the *Wood*, into
the *Sap*, in the *Barque*. Wherefore, as the *Aer-Vessels advance* the *Aer*,
or the *Aery Part* of the *Sap*, and so convey it by the *length* of the *Trunk*;
so the *Insertions filter* it, and convey it by the *breadth*.

9. §. AND that the *Insertions* have this *Office* or *Subservience*
unto both *Kinds* of *Vessels*; doth yet further appear, if we consider,
That the *Aer-Vessels* are always so postured, as to touch upon the said
*Insertions*, or at least to stand very near them. For either they are
large, and so do frequently touch upon them on both sides; as in
*Elm*, *Ash*, *Wallnut*, &c. *Tab. 28.
 29. 22.* Or if they are small; then they either run
along in even lines collateral and oftentimes contiguous with the said
*Insertions*, as in *Holly*: or at least, are reciprocally, some on one side,
and some on another, inclined to them; as in *Apple*. 25. By all which
means, the *Aer* is more readily conveyed from the *Vessels* into the *Insertions*.

10. §. A further evidence hereof is this, That generally, the bigger
and the more numerous the *Aer-Vessels* be; the bigger, or at least,
the more numerous also are the *Insertions*: Especially, if the comparison
be made (as in all other cases it ought to be, as well as here)
betwixt the several *Species* of the same *Kind*. So *Corin*, which hath
small *Aer-Vessels*, *Tab. 17.* hath also very small *Insertions*. But the *Vine*, hath
both very large: and so for others.

11. §. Wherefore, the *Insertions* minister betwixt the *Aer-Vessels*, and
the *Succiferous*; in the same manner, as the *Vesiculæ* of the *Lungs*, do
betwixt the *Bronchiæ* and the *Arteries*. That is to say, as in an *Animal*,
the *Bronchiæ* deposite the *Aer* into the *Vesiculæ* of the *Lungs*; which
administer it to the *Arteries*: so in a *Plant*, the *Aer-Vessels* deposit the
*Aer* into the *Insertions*, that is into the *Vesiculæ* of the *Insertions*; by
which it is gradually *filtred* off into the *Barque* and the *Sap-Vessels*
therein.
