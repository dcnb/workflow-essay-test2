### CHAP. I.

### Of the Motion and Course of the Sap.

![F](images/i_drop_f_1.jpg)
IRST,
as to the *Course* of the *Sap*, there are
Three *Parts* in which it *moveth*; *sc.* the *Pith*, the
*Wood* and the *Barque*. First the *Pith*; in which
the *Sap* moveth the *First year*, and *only the First
year*. Or, it is *Proprium quarto modo*, to the *Pith*
of every *Annual Growth*, and to the *Pith* of such a
*Growth* only, *To be succulent*. That is, whether of a
*Sprout* from a *Seed*, or of a *Sucker* from a *Root*, or of a *Cyon* from a
*Branch*; The *Pith* is always found the *First year* full of *Sap*. But the
*Second year*, the same individual *Pith*, always becomes *dry*, and so it
continues ever after.

2. §. One cause whereof is, that the *Lymphæducts* in the *Barque*,
being the first year adjacent to the *Pith*; they do all that time, transfuse
part of their *Sap* into it, and so keep it always *Succulent*. But the
same *Lymphæducts*, the year following, are turned into *Wood*; and
the *Vessels* which are then generated, and carry the *Sap*, stand beyond
them, in the *Barque*. So that the *Sap* being now more remote from
the *Pith*, and intercepted by the new *Wood*, it cannot be transfused,
with that sufficient force and plenty as before, into the *Pith*; which
therefore, from the first year, always continues dry.

3. §. THE SECOND *Part* in which the *Sap moves*, *sub forma
liquoris*, is the *Wood*. Which yet, it doth not in all *Plants*, but
only in some; and visibly, in very few; as in the *Vine*: In a *Vine*, I
say, the *Sap* doth *visibly ascend* by the *Wood*. And this it doth, not
only the first year, but every year, so long as the *Vine* continues to
grow. But although this *ascent*, in or through the *Wood*, be every
year; yet it is only in the *Spring*, for about the space of a Month; *sc.*
in *March* and *April*.

4. §. There are many other *Trees*, besides the *Vine*, wherein, about
the same time of the year, the *Sap ascendeth*, though not so copiously,
yet chiefly, in the *Wood*. For if we take a *Branch* of two or three
years growth, suppose of *Sallow*, and having first cut the same transversely;
if the *Barque* be then also transversely, and with some force,
pressed with the back of the knife, near the newly cut end; the *Sap*
will very plainly rise up out of the utmost *Ring* of *Wood*. And if it
be pressed in the same manner, or a little more strongly, about an Inch
lower, the *Sap* will ascend out of every *Ring* of *Wood* to the Center.
Yet at the same time, which is to be noted, there *ariseth* no *Sap* at all
out of the *Barque*.

5. §. Whence appears the Error of that so Common Opinion,
That *the Sap always riseth betwixt the Wood and the Barque*. The contrary
whereunto is most true, That it never doth. For the greater
part of the year, it riseth in the *Barque*, *sc.* in the inner *Margin* adjacent

to the *Wood*, and in *Spring*, in or through the *Wood* it self, and
there only.

6. §. THE THIRD *Part* in which the *Sap* ascends, is the
*Barque*, as was above hinted, and may be observ’d in almost any
*Branch*, if cut cross, in the *late Spring* and in *Summer*; either as the
*Sap* issueth spontaneously, or upon pressing, as aforesaid. So that
when the *Sap* ceaseth to ascend, *sub forma liquoris*, by the *Wood*, then
it begins to ascend by the *Barque*.

7. §. Besides the difference of *Time*, the *Organical Parts* likewise,
in which these two *Saps* ascend, are divers. For in the *Barque*, it
ascendeth *visibly*, only in the *Succiferous*, whereas in the *Wood*, it
ascendeth only by the *Aer-Vessels*.

8. §. FROM what hath been said, we may understand, what is
meant by the *Bleeding* of *Plants*. If we take it generally, it properly
enough expresses, *The eruption of the Sap out of any Vessels*. And so,
almost all *Plants*, in *Summer* time, do *Bleed*, that is, from *Sap-Vessels*,
either in the *Barque*, or in the *Margin* of the *Pith*: the *Saps* they
*Bleed*, having either a *Sower*, *Sweet*, *Hot*, *Bitter*, or other *Tast*. At
which time, the *Vessels* also, in the *Barque* of a *Vine-Branch*, do *Bleed*
a *Sower Sap*.

9. §. But that which is *vulgarly* called *Bleeding*, as in a *Vine*, is
quite another thing; both as to the *Liquor* which issueth, and the *Place*
where it issues: that is to say, it is neither a *Sweet*, nor *Sower*, but
*Tasteless Sap*; issuing, not from any *Vessels* in the *Barque*, but from
the *Aer-Vessels* in the *Wood*. So that there is as much difference betwixt
*Bleeding* in a *Vine*, or the *Rising* of the *Sap* in any other *Tree*,
in *March*, and in *July*; as there is betwixt *Salivation* and an *Hæmorrhage*;
or betwixt the *Course* of the *Chyle* in the *Lactiferous Vessels*, and the
*Circulation* of the *Blood* in the *Arteries* and *Veins*.

10. §. NOW the Cause from whence it comes to pass, that the
*early Spring-Sap* of a *Vine*, and other *Trees*, ascendeth by the *Wood*, is,
In that the *Generation* of the young *Sap-Vessels* in the *Barque*, by
which the *Sap* ascendeth all the *Summer*; is, in the beginning of *Spring*,
but newly attempted. So that the *Sap* having not yet these *Vessels* to
receive it, it therefore (*pro hac vice*) runs up the *Aer-Vessels* in
the *Wood*. But so soon as the said *Vessels* in the *Barque* begin to be considerably
encreased, the *Sap*, declining the *Aer-Vessels*, betakes it self to
*These*, as its most proper *Receptacles*.

11. §. THE CAUSE also, why the *Vessels* of almost all
*Plants*, upon cutting, do yield *Sap*, or *Bleed*; is the *Pressure* which the
*Parenchyma* makes upon them. For the *Pith* and other *Parenchymous
Parts* of a *Plant*, upon the reception of *Liquor*, have always a *Conatus*
to *dilate* themselves. As is manifest from *Sponges*, which are a Substance
of the same Nature, and have a somewhat like structure. As
also from *Cork*, which is but the *Parenchyma* or *Barque* of a *Tree*. I say
therefore, that the *Parenchyma* being fill’d and swell’d with *Sap*, hath
thereby a continual *Conatus* to *dilate* it self; and in the same degree,
to press together or contract the *Vessels* which it surroundeth. And
the said *Vessels* being cut, their actual *Contraction* and the *Eruption* of
the *Sap*, do both immediately follow.

12. §. IT may be also noted, That the *Trunk* or *Branch* of any *Plant*
being cut, it always *bleeds* at both ends, or upwards and downwards,

alike freely. Which, as well as divers other *Experiments* plainly
shews, That in the *Sap-Vessels* of a *Plant*, there are no *Valves*.

13. §. FROM what we have now above, and elsewhere formerly
said, we may also understand the *manner* of the *Ascent* of the *Sap*.
As to which, I say, *First*, That considering to what height and plenty,
the *Sap* sometimes ascends; it is not intelligible, how it should
thus ascend, by virtue of any one *Part* of a *Plant*, alone; that is
neither by virtue of the *Parenchyma*, nor by virtue of the *Vessels*,
alone. Not by the *Parenchyma* alone. For this, as it hath the Nature
of a *Sponge* or *Filtre*, to suck up the *Sap*; so likewise, to suck
it up but to a certain height, as perhaps, about an Inch, or two, and
no more.

14. §. Nor by the *Vessels* alone, for the same reason. For although
we see, that small *Glass-Pipes* immersed in Water, will give
it an ascent for some Inches; yet there is a certain *period*, according
to the *bore* of the *Pipe*, beyond which it will not rise. We must
therefore joyn the *Vessels* and the *Parenchyma* both together in this
Service; which we may conceive performed by them in the manner
following.

15. §. Let A B be the *Vessel* of a *Plant*. Let C E D F be the
*Bladders* of the *Parenchyma*, wherewith, as with so many little *Cisterns*,
it is surrounded. *Tab. 39.* I say then, that the *Sap*, in the *Pipe* B A, would, of
it self, rise but a few Inches; as suppose, from D to L. But the *Bladders*
D P, which surround it, being swelled up and turgid with *Sap*,
do hereby press upon it; and so not only a little contract its bore,
but also transfuse or strain some *Portion* of their *Sap* thereinto: by
both which means, the *Sap* will be forced to rise higher therein. And
the said *Pipe* or *Vessel* being all along surrounded by the like *Bladders*;
the *Sap* therein, is still forced higher and higher: the *Bladders*
of the *Parenchyma* being, as is said, so many *Cisterns* of *Liquor*, which
transfuse their repeated Supplies throughout the length of the *Pipe*.
So that by the supply and pressure of the *Cisterns* or *Bladders* F D, the
*Sap* riseth to L; by the *Bladders* Q L, it rises to M; by the
*Bladders* N M, it rises to I; by the *Bladders* O I, it rises to K; by the
*Bladders* P K, it rises to E; and so to the top of the *Tree*. And thus
far of the *Motion* of the *Sap*.
