### Of the SEED-CASE or MEMBRANEOUS
    UTERUS.

![T](images/i_drop_t_119.jpg)
O
the forementioned *Fruits*, I shall subjoyne, in some
Examples, the *Description* of the *Seed-Case*, which
is analogous to the *Fruit*. For the *Fruit*, strictly so
called, is, *A Fleshy Uterus, which grows more moist and
Pulpy, as the Seed ripens*. But the *Seed-Case*, whether
it be called a *Cod*, *Pod*, or by any other name,
is, *A Membraneous Uterus, which as the Seed ripens,
still grows the more dry and hard*: as in most *Plants*.

2. §. THE SEED-CASE, is either originally open; Or only
when the *Seed* is ripe; Or never opens at all, till the *Seed* be sown.
Of the first Sort, is that of *Luteola*; as also of *Clary*, *Sage*, *Hysop*, and

the like: wherein one and the same *Part*, is both the *Empalement* of the
*Flower*, and when that is gone, survives as the *Case* of the *Seed*.

3. §. Of the Last, is that of *Myagrum Monspermon*, *Lithosperme*,
all the *Stones* of *Fruits*, with divers others. And some *Cases*, which
are soft, as, I think, that of *Garden Radish*. The former, by cleaving
in some *part* or other; these only by roting under Ground.

4. §. THAT of *Garden Radish*, is a Light and Spongy or Pithy
*Body*; originally, every where entire. But, as it ripens, breaks within,
into several White and Dry *Membranes* round about the *Seed*. *Tab. 70.* By
the Length and about ⅛ᵗʰ of an Inch distant from the *Sides* of the *Case*,
do run a pair of little *Vascular Ropes*. Some smaller *Fibres* are from
these transmitted to the *Sides* of the *Case*; by which they are kept
tite and steady. Upon divers others produced towards the *Centre*, hang
the *Seeds*, like Two *Ropes* of *Onions*.

5. §. Of those which open so soon as the *Seed* is ripe; some are
made to open at the *Top*, as *Popy Heads*; Some on the *Side*, as most
*Cods*; and some at the *Bottom*, as that of *Coded Arsmart*.

6. §. THE *Popy-Head*, is a little *Dove Coat*; divided by Eight
or Ten *Partitions*, into so many *Stalls*. On both *Sides* the *Partitions*,
hangs a most numerous *Brood* of *Seeds*. *Tab. 70.* The *Partitions* and *Sides* of
the *Head*, are made of the *Barque*, and Lined with the *Pith*. While
young, they are very *thick* and *spongy*; and together with the *Seeds*, do
then fill all up. The *Head* is then also every where entire; but as it dries,
it gradually opens at the *Top*, into several *Windows*, one for every *Stall*:
which are all covered with a very fair *Canopy*. A *Fabrick* designed for
several purposes, as shall hereafter be said.

7. §. Of those which open on the *Side*; some are made to open,
only on One *Side*; some, on both *Sides*; some, with Three *Sides*;
some, with more; and some horizontally or round about.

8. §. THE COD of *Garden Bean* (and so the rest of the *Leguminous*
kind) opens on one *Side*. It hath a Twofold *Parenchyma*. The
Utmost derived from the *Barque*: in which stand all the *Vessels*, in several
*Parcels*; *Tab. 70.* one whereof, at the *Back* of the *Cod*, is much larger
than the rest, shaped like a *Copula* used in *Schemes*; from whence shoot
those lesser *Fibres* upon which the *Beans* do grow.

9. §. The Inner *Parenchyma* is derived from the *Pith*. Upon its
Nativity, and for some time afterwards, entire and wholly composed of
*Bladders*, as the Outer. From the *Base* of the *Cod* they are gradually
enlarged, so as to compose this *Parenchyma* into a very soft and delicate
*Sponge*. *Tab. 70.* In which (the *Cod* being well grown) the very *Threds* whereof
the *Bladders* were woven, are many of them so loose and ample, as
easily to be drawn out (as in the unroaving of *Knit-work*) to a considerable
Length, fairly visible through an ordinary *Glass*.

*B. 2. P. 1. Ch. 5.*
 & *B. 3. P. 1. Ch. 4.*
10. §. This may further confirm all that I have formerly said of the
*Fibrous Texture* of the *Pith*, and of all the other *Parenchymous Parts* of
*Plants*.

11. §. THE *Seed-Case* of *Medica*, is a *Cod* wound up: in the
*Echinata*, *Spirally*; in the *Tornata*, by an *Helix*. Not finished all together;
but, upon the fall of the *Flower*, beginning to wind, continues
its *Circles*, till it be come to its full *Growth*.

12. §. THE *Seed-Case* of *Yellow Henbean* opens on both *Sides*.
*Tab. 70.* On the *Top*, is erected a *Colum*, about ½ an Inch long; which, as the
*Case* swells, grows less, and at last falls off. On the *Sides* of the *Uterus*
or *Case*, Two *Vascular Fibres* run oppositely from the bottom to the
top, and so into the *Colum*. Along the *Tract* of these *Fibres*, the *Case*,
as it ages, gradually cleaves on both *Sides* asunder.

13. §. The *Case* is lined with a dry and thin *Parchment*, as
smooth as *Glass*. *Tab. 70.* In the *Centre* of the *Case*, stands a great *Parenchymous
Boss*, which is, as it were, the *Bed* or *Placentula* of the *Seeds*; which
lie all over it, as in a *Strawberry*. And so in many other *Plants*.
Throughout this *Bed*, the *Vessels* for the *Generation* and *Nourishment* of
the *Seeds*, are distributed; one very small *Fibre*, shooting, from the
direct ones, obliquely into each *Seed*.

14. §. THE *Seed-Case* of *Tulip*, opens with Three *Sides*; being,
when young, a *Prism* or long *Triangle*. From the midle of each
*Side*, a *Partition* or *Boord* is produced; all three meeting in the *Centre*
of the *Case*; *Tab. 71.* and so parting it into Six *Stalls* for the *Seed*. The insides
hereof, are, lined with a thin smooth and glossy *Parchment*, like
that in *Hen-bean*; derived from the *Pith*; as the outside, from the
*Barque*: and so in many other *Seed-Cases*.

15. §. The *Vessels*, after they rise above the *Stalk*, are disposed
with great *artifice*. For first, they are divided into Three principal
*Branches*, which run a long the Three *Angles* of the *Case*; *Tab. 71.* where the
Three *Sides*, as it ages, gradually cleave asunder. From these chief
*Branches*, at the Three *Angles*, divers lesser ones run horizontally, and
meet at the midle of each *Side*. From whence again, many yet smaller
ones are produced through the bredth of each *Partition* to their Edges
in the *Centre* of the *Case*. Where, once more, they are distributed into
very fine and short *Threds*, whereupon hang the *Seeds*.

16. §. THE *Seed-Case* of *Stramonium* or *Thorn Apple*, is divided
into Four *Closets*: Not open one into another, as in *Poppy*, *Tulip*, &c.
but so many distinct *Inclosures*. *Tab. 71.* In the midst of each *Closet* stands a
*Colum*, joyned to the *Side* of the *Closet* by a *Wall* or *Lamine*. Through
the Length of the *Colums* run several greater and lesser *Branches* of
*Vessels*, from whence others are obliquely produced, upon which the
*Seeds* grow.

17. §. THE *Seed-Case* of *Anagallis* or *Pimpernel*, is a little *Globe*;
which opens not by its *Meridian* or *Vertically*, as do the former; but
by its *Horizon*. *Tab. 71.* For divers very small *Fibres*, being produced from the
*Stalk* to the midle of the *Case*; do there fetch a *Circle*, and so divide it
exactly into Two *Hemispheres*: the Uppermost of which, when the
*Seeds* are ripe, falleth off; and so the wind sowes them.

18. §. THE *Seed-Case* of *Coded Arsmart*, neither opens at the
*Top*, nor on the *Sides*, as do all the former; but at the *Bottom*. It is
composed of Four *Sides*: the Outer Part of which, is softer and more
*succulent*; *Tab. 71.* the Inner a tite and strong *Membrane*. In the *Centre* of the
*Case*, is erected a *Pole* or *Colum* upon which the *Seeds* do all hang very
loosely.

19. §. From this *Mechanism*, the manner of that violent and surprising
*Ejaculation* of the *Seeds*, is intelligible. Which is not a motion
originally in the *Seeds* themselves; but contrived by the *Structure* of
the *Case*. For the *Seeds* hanging very loose, and not on the *Sides* of

the *Case*, as sometimes, but on the *Pole*, in the *Centre*, with their
thicker end downward, they stand ready for a discharge: and the *Sides*
of the *Case* being lined with a strong and Tensed *Membrane*, they hereby
perform the office of so many little *Bows*: which, remaining fast
at the *Top*, and (contrary to what we see in other *Plants*) opening or
being *lett off* at the *Bottom*, forceably curle upward, and so drive all
the *Seeds* before them.
