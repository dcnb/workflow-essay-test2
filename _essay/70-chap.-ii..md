AVING
 given several Instances of tryal upon
    *Vegetables*; I next proceed to *Minerals*, which,
    for some orders sake, I shall distribute into five
    or six sorts, *sc.* *Earths*, *Stones*, *Ores* and *Metals*,
    *Sulphurs*, and *Salts*.

2. §. *First for Earths. Oyl of Vitriol upon
    Fullers Earth, doth not stir it, or cause the least
    Bullition. Nor upon yellow Oker. Nor upon the
    Oker which falls from green Vitriol. The same
    Oyl of Vitriol and Spirit of Harts-Horn poured severally upon Bolus Armena
    of two kinds, and upon one kind of Terra sigillata, stir none of
    them.* Hence *Bolus’s* are the *Beds*, or as it were, the *Materia prima*,
    both of opacous *Stones*, and *Metals*; into which the said *Bolus’s* are
    transmuted, by being *concentred* with divers kinds of *Salts* and *Sulphurs*,
    which successively flow in upon them.

3. §. *Aqua fortis, and Oyl of Vitriol being poured severally upon another
    sealed Earth, which was vended by the name of Terra Lemnia; they
    both made a very considerable Effervescence herewith.* Whence it appears,
    That there is no small difference in the nature, and therefore the operation
    of *Bolus Armena* and *Terra Lemnia*. As also, betwixt the sealed
    Earths themselves, one making a great *Effervescence*, another none at
    all. Whereto those that use them, are to have regard.

4. §. *Next for Stones. And first, Irish Slat, with Spirit of Harts-horn,
    maketh a small, yet visible Bullition: and it presently ceaseth.* So
    that it seems to be nothing else but a *Vitriolick Bole*. As is also argued
    from its taste, which is plainly acid, and somewhat rough. Whence
    also it is with good reason given upon any inward Bruises. Because
    by coagulating the Blood, it prohibits its too copious afflux into the
    affected part. Yet being but gently astringent, and so the Coagulations
    it makes, not great; they are likewise well enough carried off from
    the same part in the Circulation; by both which means an Inflammation
    may be either prevented, or the better over-ruled.

5. §. *Lapis Hæmatites maketh no Effervescence at all either with Alkalies
    or Acids.*

6. §. *Powder of the green part of a Magnet with Oyl of Vitriol maketh
    some few bubbles, yet not visible without a Glass. But the powder of
    the black part of a Magnet, which is the said stone fully perfect, stirreth
    not with any acid. Neither doth the calcined Magnet.* Hence there is
    some considerable difference betwixt *Iron* and the *Magnet*.

7. §. *Lapis Lazuli, with Oil of Vitriol, and especially with Spirit of
    Nitre, maketh a conspicuous Bullition.* Hence its *Cathartick* virtue lyeth
    in an *Alkaly*. For which reason it is also appropriate, in like manner
    as *Steel*, to the cure of *Hypochondriacal Affections*; originated from
    some kind of fermenting Acid.

8. §. *Osteocolla, with Spirit of Nitre maketh yet a greater Effervescence.*
    How it comes to be so great a knitter of broken Bones, as it is reputed,
    is obscure. It seemeth, that upon its solution by a *Nitrous Acid*
    in the body; it is *precipitated* upon the broken part, and so becomes a
    kind of *Cement* thereto.

9. §. *Lapis Tuthiæ, with Spirit of Nitre, maketh an Effervescence
    much alike. And with Oyl of Vitriol very considerably. But Lapis Calaminaris
    with Oyl of Vitriol grows stark; as the powder of Alabaster doth
    with water. With Spirit of Nitre it maketh a little Bullition, and quickly.
    But with Aqua fortis, a great one; beyond any of the Stones above named.*
    Hence both *Tutty* and *Calamy* are *Ophthalmicks* from their *Alkaly*.
    Which is also confirmed, from the efficacy of some *Alkalies* of the like
    use. Hence also *Calamy* seemeth to partake somewhat of the nature of
    *Silver*: as by tryal made upon that also, will hereafter better appear.

10. §. *Chalk and Oil of Sulphur or Vitriol make as strong an Effervescence
    as any of the rest.* Whence it is sometimes well used against a
    Cardialgia.

11. §. *Whiting makes as great an Effervescence as Chalk.* So that it
    seems the saline parts are not washed away with the water, wherein
    the Chalk, for the making of Whiting, is dissolved.

12. §. *Talk will not stir in the least either with Spirit of Nitre, or
    Oyl of Vitriol. But the Lead-Spar maketh a considerable Effervescence with
    both of them severally.* Hence, however this be also called *English Talk*,
    yet there is no small difference betwixt this, and true *Talk*.

13. §. *To these Stones may be added petrified bodies. As petrified wood;
    which (that upon which I made tryal) no acid stirreth in the least. Petrified
    shells; upon four or five several sorts whereof, Oyl of Vitriol being poured,
    produceth a great Effervescence. The Root or rougher part of the stone called*
    Glossopetra, *with Spirit of Nitre, makes a conspicuous Bullition.* Asteria,
    *the Stone so called, and found in some places in* England, *with Oyl of
    Vitriol, maketh an Effervescence at the same degree. So doth the Belemnites,
    or Thunder-Stone, both the larger and the lesser kinds.* So that
    none of these are *acid*, or *vitriolick*, but *alkalizate* Stones.

14. §. *Coraline, with Oyl of Vitriol, makes a conspicuous Bullition,
    yet mild and gentle; that is, with very little, if any heat, and without
    any visible Fumes. And red and white Coral do the like.* Hence they
    are all of a very gentle operation, and fit for Children, as the case requires.

15. §. *Magistery of Coral (prepared the ordinary way) stirreth not
    in the least, either with Alkalies or Acids.* Whence it is evident, That its
    active Principles are in its preparation destroyed and washed away:
    that is to say, It is an elaborate Medicine good for nothing. And thus
    far of Stones.

16. §. *I next come to Metals and Ores. And first for Lead; upon which
    Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Nitre, or Aqua fortis being dropped, it stirreth not
    in the least with any of them: but with Oyl of Sulphur, and especially with
    Oyl of Vitriol it maketh a slow Bullition and froth.* Hence it seemeth to be
    *the most alkalizate Metal*. Which is also confirmed by a foregoing Experiment
    upon the *Lead-Spar*, which maketh a considerable Effervescence
    with any sort of *acid*. And which likewise, being calcined,
    yieldeth a good quantity of *Lixivial Salt*.

17. §. *Lead-Ore stirreth not at all with Aqua fortis or Oil of Vitriol.
    But Spirit of Salt makes it bubble, and Spirit of Nitre makes it boil.*
    Hence there is a considerable difference betwixt the perfect Metal and
    the Ore.

18. §. *Burnt Lead and red Lead, make a very small Bullition with
    Oyl of Vitriol, with Spirit of Nitre a far greater.*

19. §. *Mercury, with Oyl of Vitriol, will not stir, nor with Oyl of Sulphur.
    But with Spirit of Nitre presently boyls up.* Hence *Mercury* is a
    *subacid Metal*; *Spirit* of *Nitre* being a *subalkaline Acid*.
      

    20. §. *The filings of Iron or Steel, with Oyl of Vitriol, make a fair
    Bullition, like that of Minium. But Spirit of Nitre makes them boil with
    much celerity.* Hence Iron is likewise a *subacid Metal*.

21. §. *Steel prepared with Sulphur maketh a far less Effervescence
    with the same Spirit of Nitre, than do the filings.* Hence there is a great
    difference in their strength. So that ten grains of the filings unprepared,
    will go as far as fifteen grains or more of those which are prepared,
    as above-said. Yet in some cases the weaker and milder may be the
    better.

22. §. *There is one Circumstance in the mixture of Steel and Aqua
    fortis, which is surprizing; and that is this, That strong Aqua fortis,
    dropped upon Steel, will not, of it self, make the least Bullition: but if*

 *hereto you only add a drop or two of Water, they presently boil up with very
    great vehemency.* The Cause is obscure; yet it is well known, that
    *Water* it self will dissolve *Iron*: so that it appears, as well by this, as
    by some other Experiments, that even in common Water, as mild as it
    is, there is some kind of corrosive Principle.

23. §. *Antimony with Spirit of Nitre, and Aqua fortis severally,
    maketh an Effervescence; somewhat lower than Iron. With Oil of Vitriol
    the Bullition is so small, as difficulty to be perceived with a Glass.*
    Hence it seemeth to be of a very compounded nature; if I may so call
    it, a subacid-alkaline Metal.

24. §. *Antimonium Diaphoreticum, with Spirit of Nitre and Oil
    of Vitriol severally, makes a considerable Effervescence.* Wherefore it is
    not an useless *Preparation*; as from the *Calcination* and *Ablution* used
    therein, some have thought.

25. §. *Bezoardicum Minerale, (that upon which I made tryal)
    stirreth not at all either with Alkalies or Acids.* To which, let those
    who make use of it, have regard.

26. §. *Tin, with Spirit of Nitre, makes so hot and vehement an Effervescence,
    that it turns presently, as it were, into a Coal. It makes
    also a fair Bullition with Oyl of Vitriol. And a gentle one with Spirit
    of Salt.* Wherefore, it hath something of the nature both of *Iron*,
    *Lead*, and *Copper*.

27. §. *The like remarkable circumstance is seen in the mixture of
    Aqua fortis with Tin, as with Iron. For Tin and strong Aqua fortis
    of themselves will not stir; but add a few drops of water to them, and
    they boyl up with the greatest vehemency.*

28. §. *Copper, with Spirit of Salt, and Oyl of Vitriol severally, stirs
    not at all. Spirit of Nitre, and Aqua fortis, both boil it up vehemently.
    Neither Spirit of Harts-horn, nor spirit of Salt Armoniac maketh any Bullition
    therewith. But both of them, by a gentle solution, that is, gently
    separating its Sulphur from its Salts, turn it blue.* Hence *Copper* hath
    a greater proportion of *acid* than *any* of the forementioned *Metals*.

29. §. *Silver, neither with Spirit of Salt, nor Oyl of Vitriol makes any
    Bullition. With Spirit of Nitre it makes one, but ’tis soon over: and then
    continues to dissolve slowly into white Coagulations. It also maketh with
    Spirit of Harts-horn, or of Salt Armoniac, a full and deep blue.* Hence
    there is a greater proportion of *acid* in *Silver*, than in *Lead*, *Mercury*,
    *Iron*, *Antimony*, *Tin*, or *Copper*.

30. §. *Litharge of Silver maketh the greatest Effervescence with Oyl
    of Vitriol. Yet some with Spirit of Nitre. And with Spirit of Salt Armoniac
    maketh some little huff or elevation. And being mixed with Spirit
    of Nitre and Spirit of Salt Armoniac both together, produceth a faint
    blue.* Hence, although the far greater part of this *Litharge* be but
    *Lead*; yet, it seems, it hath some small mixture of *Silver*. But that
    of *Gold* seemeth, for contrary reasons, not to have any *Gold*.

31. §. *Gold maketh no Effervescence with any single Salt I know of.
    But it is commonly dissolved with Aqua Regis, which is known to be an
    alkaline Liquor.* Whence it seemeth, That as *Lead* is the *most alkalizate*,
    so *Gold* the *most acid* of *Metals*.

32. §. These things considered, and other observations added hereunto,
    may possibly give some directions, not only for the ordering and
    using, but even for the making, imitating and transmuting of *Metals*.
    Thus far of *Metals*.

33. §. *I will next give one or two Instances of tryal upon Sulphurs.
    And first Sulphur vive, with Aqua fortis, maketh an apparent Bullition,
    but it is some time, before it begins. But the factitious or common Brimstone,
    maketh scarce any, if any at all.* So that there is no small difference
    betwixt them.

34. §. *White and yellow Arsenick make no Bullition either with Alkalies
    or Acids.* Wherefore the strength of its operation on the Body,
    lies more in a *Sulphur* than a *Salt*; or in a Salt drowned in its *Sulphur*.

35. §. *The ashes either of Pit-Coal, or Sea-Coal, make no Effervescence
    with Alkalies or Acids.* Whence the saline Principle is altogether
    volatile, and sublimed away by the fire.

36. §. *Lastly for Salts. And first of all, Borax maketh no Effervescence
    nor any Fumes with Oyl of Vitriol or Spirit of Nitre.*

37. §. *Oyl of Vitriol and Nitre make fumes or steams, though no
    Effervescence.*

38. §. *Green Vitriol, with Spirit of Harts-Horn, is scarcely moved.
    White Vitriol, with the same Spirit, maketh a conspicuous huff. And Roman
    Vitriol a vehement Effervescence.* Whence the *former* is the *least
    acid*, and the *latter the most of all*. Which also confirms what I said
    before of the like natures of the several *Metals* to which they belong.

39. §. *Salt of Vitriol, though a fixed Salt, and made by Calcination,
    yet maketh no Effervescence with the strongest acid; but only with Alkalies;
    as may be seen upon their mixture, but much better heard by holding
    the mixture to ones ear.* Hence, there are *fixed Acids*. Which
    further confirms what I have above asserted concerning the nature of
    *Gold*, *sc.* That the *predominant Salt* thereof is a *fixed Acid*.

40. §. *Sal Martis, with Spirit of Harts-horn, maketh a considerable
    huff.* Hence it is much more *acid* than *green Vitriol*; and is therefore
    a cooler body.

41. §. *Alum and Spirit of Harts-horn make a plain Effervescence.*

42. §. *Saccharum Saturni, with Oyl of Vitriol, stirs not at all.
    With Spirit of Salt, huffs a little. With Spirit of Nitre much more.*
    Hence the *acid* of the *Vinegar*, and not the *Alkaly* of the *Lead*, is the
    predominant Principle.

43. §. *Common Salt stirs neither with Spirit of Salt, nor with Spirit
    of Nitre; nor with Aqua fortis. But with Oyl of Vitriol it maketh
    a great Effervescence with noise and steams.* Hence, even common Salt,
    though it be not reckoned amongst *alkaline Salts*, yet is far nearer in
    nature to *that*, than to an *acid*. Hence also the *Spirit of Salt* is a *subalkaline
    Acid*, and of a very different nature from *Oyl* of *Sulphur* or
    *Vitriol*.

44. §. *Salt Armoniac, with Spirit of Nitre, stirreth not. But
    with Oyl of Vitriol it maketh a great Effervescence.* Hence *Spirit of
    Nitre* is a *subalkalizate Spirit*.

45. §. *Oyl of Vitriol and Spirit of Nitre, though both acids, yet make
    a great smoak; greater than that which the Spirit maketh of it self.*
    Which confirms the last precedent *Corollary*.

46. §. *Oyl of Vitriol and Spirit of Salt, though both acids, yet
    make a strong Effervescence, with noise and fumes.* Which further confirms,
    what was noted before, *sc.* that Spirit of Salt is a *subalkaline
    Acid*.

47. §. *Spirit of Salt Armoniac, with Oyl of Vitriol, makes an Effervescence
    so extraordinary quick, and as it were instantaneous, that nothing
    seemeth quicker.* Whence it is probable, That if *Gun-powder* were
    made of *Salt Armoniac*, instead of *Nitre*, or with *both* mixed together;
    it would be *far stronger*, than any kind now in use. And thus far for
    *Minerals*.

48. §. I have only one *Corollary* to add, from the whole; which
    is, That whoever doth undertake the *Natural History* of a *Country*,
    (such as that the Learned Dr. *Plot* hath exceedingly well done of *Oxfordshire*)
    the foregoing *Method*, seemeth so easie, cheap, and indeceitful,
    for the finding out and well distinguishing the natures of all
    kinds of *Metalls*, *Ores*, *Salts*, *Earths*, *Stones*, or other *subterraneal Bodies*;
    as cannot, I think, be supply’d, but by others of greater difficulty
    and expence.
