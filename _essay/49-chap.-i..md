the Fruits of Plants vulgarly called POMIFEROUS.

![T](images/i_drop_t_164.jpg)
HE
*Description* and *Use* of *Leaves* and *Flowers*,
together with the *Figures* thereto belonging, were
presented to this *Honourable Society*, the last year.
I shall conclude this Subject with *Fruits* and
*Seeds*; beginning with *Fruits*, which will take
up the present Discourse.

2. §. And First, I shall describe the Compounding
*Parts* of some, more generally known.
Which having done, I shall next observe the *Uses* of the same; either
for the *Fruit* it self, or for the *Seed*. Some of the *Descriptions*, the
Reader may be pleased to compare with those in the *First* **Book**.
 *Ch. 6.*
I begin with the *Apple*; to which I shall subjoyn the *Limon*, and *Cucumer*,
commonly reduced to the *Pome Kind*.

3. §. AN APPLE, besides the *Skin*, consisteth of a *Parenchyma*,
*Vessels*, and *Coar*. The *Parenchyma* or *Pulp*, is the same with that of the
*Barque* of the *Tree*. As is apparent, not only from the visible continuation
thereof from the one, through the *Stalk*, into the other: but
also from the Structure common to them both; being both composed
of *Bladders*. In which, notwithstanding, there is this difference,

That whereas in the *Barque*, they are *spherical*, and very small, most of
them, through a good *Glass*, not exceeding 1/16ᵗʰ of an Inch in *Diametre*,
and some of them, less: here, they are oblong and very large, most
of them about ⅓ᵈ of an Inch in Length, or more, according to the largeness
and tenderness of the *Fruit*; *Tab. 65.* being all uniformly tenter’d or
stretched out, by the *arching* of the *Vessels*, from the *Coar* towards the
Circumference of the *Apple*.

4. §. The *Vessels*, as in the other *Parts* of a *Plant*, are *Succiferous*,
and for *Aer*. Both the *Branches* of the former, and the single *Vessels*
of the latter, are extream small. They run every where together, not
collateral, as *Veins* and *Arteries* do in *Animals*; *Tab. 65.* but the latter, sheathed
in the former.

5. §. They are distributed into Twenty principal *Branches*. The Ten
outmost, a little within the *Apple*, are diverted from a straight *Line*, into
so many great *Arches*; from which a few small *Fibres* are without any
order dispearsed through the *Apple*. The Five middlemost, and the
Five inmost, run in a straight *Line* as far as the *Coar*, and are there diverted
into as many lesser *Arches*; *Tab. 65.* the former, at the outer, and the
latter at the iner *Angles* of the *Coar*. Upon these Five inmost hang all
the *Seeds*.

6. §. These Ten, and the other Ten abovesaid, do all meet together
at the top of the *Apple*, where originally, they all ran into the
*Flower*. *Tab. 65.* But betwixt them, there are scarce any intercurrent *Fibres*;
so that they appear every where disjunct from the bottom to the top
of the *Apple*.

7. §. A LIMON hath a Threefold *Parenchyma*; which seem
to be derived one from another: the *Texture*, upon every derivation,
being somewhat altered, and so made more close and elaborate. *Tab. 66.* The
utmost, called the *Rind*, hath the most open, and the coursest *Texture*;
being composed of the largest *Threds*, and those *Threds* woven up into
larger *Bladders*. Those little *Cells*, which contein the *Essential Oyl* of
the *Fruit*, and stand near the Surface of the *Rind*, are some of the said
*Bladders* much more dilated.

8. §. From this utmost *Parenchyma*, Nine or Ten *Insertions* or *Lamels*
are produced, betwixt as many *Portions* of the *Pulpy Part*, towards
the Centre, where they all unite into one *Body*, answerable to
the *Pith* in the *Trunk* or *Root* of a *Tree*; and is a conspicuous demonstration,
of the communion betwixt the *Barque* and the *Pith*; which
there, is much more obscure and difficult to observe. *Tab. 66.* At the bottom,
but especially the top of the *Fruit*, the *Pith* is so far expanded, as without
the mediation of any *Lamels*, to be joyned to the *Rind*.

9. §. Throughout this *Parenchyma*, the *Vessels* are dispearsed. But
the chief *Branches* stand on the iner Edge of the *Rind*, and the outer
Edge of the *Pith*, *Tab. 66.* just at the two extremities of every *Lamel*. From
those *Branches* on the Edge of the *Pith*, other little and very short
ones shoot into the *Pulp* of the *Fruit*, upon which the *Seeds* are appendant.
In the Centre of the *Pith*, are Eight or Nine, in a *Ring*,
which run through the *Fruit* up to the *Flower*.

10. §. Between the *Rind* and the *Pith* and those several *Lamels*,
which joyn them together, stands the second Sort of *Parenchyma*, different
from the former, in being somewhat closer, and finer wrought
Divided, by the *Lamels*, into several distinct Bodies; every one of them
a great and entire *Bag*.

11. §. Within every great *Bag*, is conteined a Third *Parenchyma*,
which is also a Cluster of other little *Bags*, about the bigness of an
*Oate*, all disjoyned one from another, and having their distinct *Stalks*, *Tab. 66.*
of several *Lengths*, by which they are all fastned to the utmost Side of
the great *Bag*, wherein they are conteined. Within each of these lesser
*Bags* are conteined many hundreds of *Bladders*, consisting of most extream
fine *Threds* woven up together into that *Figure*. Within these
*Bladders* lies the *Acid Juyce* of the *Limon*.

12. §. A CUCUMER, hath also a Threefold *Parenchyma*. The
Utmost, is derived, from the **Barque**. In this, being exposed for some
time to dry, and then cut transversly with a *Rasor*; not only the *Bladders*,
but also the *Threds* whereof the *Bladders* consist, through a good
*Microscope*, are apparent.

13. §. Throughout this *Parenchyma* the *Sap-Vessels* are dispersed;
near the Circumference, in Ten or Twelve very large *Branches*. *Tab. 66.* Each
of these larger *Branches*, embosoms another of *Aer-Vessels* in its Centre.
Adjacent to the Midle *Parenchyma*, they stand in *Clustres* of much
smaller *Branches*, but more numerous.

14. §. Out of all these *Sap-Vessels*, issues a transparent and viscous
*Mucilage*; which being dryed, becomes as hard and tough as *Gum Tragacanth*.
Analogous to which, I suppose, is the truly purgative part of
*Elaterium*.

15. §. The Midle *Parenchyma* is derived from the *Pith*; and divided
into Three *Colums*, standing triangularly, and having each of them
a *Triangular Figure*. *Tab. 66.* Within these *Colums* stand a distinct Sort of *Sap-Vessels*:
from whence, several small and short *Fibres* shoot into the Inmost
*Parenchyma*, whereupon the *Seeds* do hang. So that these *Columns*
are as it were the *Beds* on which the *Seeds* grow. With each of the
*Seed-Branchs* or *Fibres*, goes some part of the said *Parenchyma* or *Colum*,
out of which, the *Covers* of the *Seed* are formed.

16. §. The Inmost *Parenchyma* wherein the *Seeds* lie, and which
answers to the *Pulp* of a *Limon*, seems likewise to be derived from the
*Colums*, *Tab. 66.* that is, to be originally thence produced upon the *Seed-Fibres*,
and afterwards spread and augmented into a *Pulp*. By Three *Insertions*
from the *Colums*, and as many from the Utmost *Parenchyma*, and
these re-inserted; it is divided into Six *Triangular Bodies*; and every
*Triangle*, into Three *Ovals*.

17. §. A near resemblance betwixt the *Garden* and *Wild Cucumer*,
with respect to the Inward *Structure*, as well as the Outward *Figure*,
may be observed: *Tab. 66.*
 Both of them having a Threefold *Parenchyma*. Yet
with this difference, That the Three *White Triangular Bodies* or *Colums*
in the one, is answered by a *White Ring* or *Tube* in the other.
