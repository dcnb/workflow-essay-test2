O *Philosophize*, is, To render the *Causes* and *Ends*
of Things. No man, therefore, that denieth *God* can do this,
Truly. *Theology* the Beginning and End
of *Philosophy*. For the taking away of the *first
Cause*, maketh all things *Contingent*. Now, of that which is
*Contingent*, although there may be an *Event*; yet there
can be no *Reason* or *End*: so that Men should then study,
That, which *is not*. So the *Causes* of Things, if they are
*Contingent*, they cannot be *Constant*. For that which is
the *Cause* of This, now; if it be so *Contingently*, it may
not be the *Cause* hereafter: and no *Physical* Proposition,
grounded upon the *Constancy* and Certainty of Things, could
have any foundation. He, therefore, that philosophiseth, and denieth
*God*, playeth a childish Game.

2. §. Wherefore *Nature*, and the
*Causes* and *Reasons* of Things, duly contemplated,
naturally lead us unto *God*; and is one way of securing our
Veneration of Him: giving us, not only a general Demonstration
of his *Being*; but a particular one, of most of the
several *Qualifications* thereof. For all *Goodness*,
*Righteousness*, *Proportion*, *Order*, *Truth*, or
whatever else is Excellent and Amiable in the *Creatures*; it is
the Demonstration of the like in *God*. For it is impossible, that
*God*

should ever make any thing, not like Himself, in some degree or
other. These Things, and the very Notions which we have of them, are
*Conceptions* issuing from the *Womb* of the *Divine
Nature*.

3. §. By the same means, we have a greater
assurance of the Excellency of his *Sacred Word*. That He,
who hath *Done* all things so transcendently well; must needs
*Speak* as well, as he hath *Done*. That He, who in so
admirable a manner, hath *made* Man; cannot but know best,
What his true *Principles* and *Faculties* are; and what
*Actions* are most agreeable thereunto: and, that having
adorned him with such *Beauteous* and *Lovely* ones; it
is impossible, He should ever put him upon the Exercise of those
*Faculties*, in any way *Deformed* and *Unlovely*. That
He should do all things, so well *Himself*; and yet require his
*Creatures*, to do otherwise, is unconceivable.

4. §. And as we may come, hereby, to rectifie
our Apprehension of His *Laws*; so also, of His *Misteries*.
For there are many Things, of the *Manner* of whose Existence, we
have no certain Knowledge. Yet, of their *Existence*, we are as
sure, as our *Senses* can make us. But, we may as well deny, what
*God* hath Made, *To be*; as, what he hath Spoken, *To be
true*, because we understand not *how*. And the knowledge of
*Things* being gradually attained, we have occasion to reflect,
That some *Things*, we can now well conceive, which we once
thought unintelligible. I know, therefore, what I *understand*
not; but, I know not, what is *unintelligible*: what I know not
now, I may hereafter; or if not I, another; or if *no Man*,
or other *Creature*, it is sufficient, *That God fully
understandeth Himself*. It is not, therefore, the *Knowledge*
of *Nature*, but they are the *wanton phansies* of Mens
minds, that dispose them, either to Forget *God*, or to Think
unduly of Him.

5. §. Nor have we reason to fear going *too
far*, in the Study of *Nature*; more, than the *entring*
into it: Because, the higher we rise in the true Knowledg and due
Contemplation of *This*; the nearer we come to the *Divine
Author* hereof. Or to think, that there is any Contradiction, when
*Philosophy* teaches that to be done by *Nature*; which
*Religion*, and the *Sacred Scriptures*, teach us to be
done by *God*: no more, than to say, That the *Ballance*
of a *Watch* is moved by the next *Wheel*; is to deny that
*Wheel*, and the rest, to be moved by the *Spring*; and that
both the *Spring*, and all the other *Parts*, are caused to
move together by the *Maker* of them. So *God* may be truly
the *Cause* of *This Effect*, although a Thousand other
*Causes* should be supposed to intervene: For all *Nature* is
as one Great *Engine*, made by, and held in His Hand. And as it is
the Watch-makers *Art*, that the *Hand* moves regularly, from
hour to hour, although he put not his Finger still to it: So is it the
Demonstration of *Divine Wisdome*, that the Parts of *Nature*
are so harmoniously contrived and set together; as to conspire to all
kind of Natural Motions and Effects, without the Extraordinary and
Immediate Influence of the *Author* of it.

6. §. Therefore, as the *Original Being* of
all Things, is the most proper Demonstration of *Gods Power*: So
the *successive Generations*, and *Operations* of Things are
the most proper Demonstration of his *Wisdom*. For if we should
suppose,that *God* did now make, or do any Thing, by any Thing;
then, no *Effect* would be produced by a *Natural Cause*: and
consequently, He would still be upon the Work of *Creation*: which
yet *Sacred Scripture* assureth us, He *resteth from*. And we
might exspect

the Formation of a *Child*, in an *Egg*, as well as in a
*Womb*; or of a *Chicken*, out of a *Stone*, as an
*Egg*: And all Sorts of *Animals*, as well as *Plants*,
might propagate their *Species*, without Coition: and the like.
For *Infinite Power*, needeth not make any difference in the
Things it undertakes to manage. But in that, these Things are not only
*made*, but *so made*, that is, according to such certain
Natural Laws, as to produce their *Natural Effects*; here is the
Sensible and Illustrious Evidence of his *Wisdom*. Wherefore as
the Wisdom of Government, is not seen, by the King his interposing
Himself in every Case; but in the contrivance of the *Laws*, and
Constitution of *Ministers* in such sort, that it shall be as
effectually determin’d, as if he did so indeed: So the more complicated
and vastly Numerous, we allow the *Natural Causes* of Things
to be; the more duely we conceive of that *Wisdom*, which thus
disposeth of them all, to their several *Effects*: All Things
being thus, as *Ministers* in the Hands of *God*, conspiring
together a Thousand *Ways*, towards a Thousand *Effects* and
*Ends*, at one time; and that with the same certainty, as if he
did prepose to each, the same Omnipotent *Fiat*, which he used at
the Creation of the World.

7. §. THIS *Universal Monarchy*, as it is eminently Visible in all
other Particular *Oeconomies*; so is it, no less, in that of *Vegetables*.
Infinite Occurrences, and secret Intrigues, ’tis made up of; of which
we cannot skill, but by the help of manifold *Means*; and those, in
the foregoing *Idea*, have been lately proposed. The Divine Wisdom seen in the Growth of *Plants*; if we observe, Wherein, although
some *Experiments* have been briefly touch’d: yet that which I have
hitherto chiefly prosecuted, hath been the *Anatomical* Part; and that
not throughly neither. Notwithstanding, so far as Observations
already made will conduct us, I shall endeavour to go. And if, for
the better clearing of the way, I have intermixed some Conjectures; I
think they are not meerly such, but for which I have layd down some
Grounds, and of which, the *Series* also of the following *Discourse*, may
be some further proof.

*First*, How the *Ground* is prepared.
8. §. LET US say then, that the *Root* of a *Plant* being lodged in
some Soil, for its more convenient growth; ’tis necessary the Soil
should be duly prepared for it. The *Rain*, therefore, falling and soaking
into the Soyl, somewhat diluteth the Dissoluble *Principles* therein
contained; and renders them more easily communicable to the
*Root*: Being as a *Menstruum*, which extracteth those *Principles*, from
the other greater and useless part of the Soil.

9. §. And the warm *Sun*, joyned with the diluting *Rain*, by both,
as it were a *Digestion* of the Soil, or a gentile *Fermentation* amongst its
several Parts, will follow: whereby the Dissoluble Parts therein, will
rot and mellow: that is, those *Principles* which as yet remained more
*fixed*, will now be further *resolved and unlocked*, and more copiously
and equally spread themselves through the Body of the Soil.

10. §. These *Principles*, being with the growth of *Plants* continually
exhausted, and needing a repair; the successions, therefore, of
Wet, Wind, and other Weather, beat down and rot the *Leaves* and
other *Parts* of *Plants*. Whereby these (as *Weeds* which are wont to
be buried under ground) become a *natural Manure*, and Re-impregnate

the Soil: Being thus, in part, out of their own Resolved *Principles*,
annually Compounded again.

11. §. Many of these *Principles*, upon their *Resolution*, being by
the *Sun* more attenuated and volatilized; continually ascend into
the *Aer*, and are mixed therewith. Where, although they lose not
their *Vegetable Nature*, yet being amongst other purer *Principles*; themselves
also, depositing their Earthy feculencies, become more subtile,
simple and Essential Bodies.

12. §. And the *Aer* being of an *Elastick* or *Springy* Nature, pressing,
more or less, upon all Bodies; it thereby forceth and insinuateth
it self into the Soil, through all its permeable Pores. Upon its own
entrance, it carries also many of the said *Vegetable* and *Essential Principles*
along with it; which, together with the rest, are spread all over
the Body of the Soil. By which means, though a less Vehement, yet
more Subtil *Fermentation*, and with the least advantage of warmth,
continuable, will be effected.

13. §. The *Principles* being thus farther *resolved* and subtilized,
would presently exhale away, if the *Rain*, again, did not prevent.
Which, therefore, falling upon and soaking through the Ground, is as a
fresh *Menstruum*, saturate or impregnate with many of them. And as
it still sinketh lower, it carries them along with it self, from the Superficial,
to the Deeper parts of the Ground: thus, not only maturing
those parts also, which, otherwise, would be more lean and cold;
but therein likewise, laying up and securing a *Store*, more gradually
and thriftily to be bestowed upon the Upper parts again, as they need.

14. §. And *Autumn* having laid up the *Store*, *Winter* following
thereupon, doth, as it were, lock the doors upon it. In which time,
some warmer Intervals, serve further and gradually to mature the stored
*Principles*, without hazard of their being Exhaled. And the *Spring*
returning, sets the doors open again, with warmer and more constant
*Sun*, with gentle and frequent *Rain*, fully resolves the said *Principles*;
and so furnisheth a plentiful Diet, for all kinds of *Vegetables*:
being a *Composition* of *Water* chiefly, wherein are resolved, some portions
of *Earth*, *Salt*, *Acid*, *Oyl*, *Spirit*, and *Aer*; or other Bodies of
Affinity herewith.

*Then*, How the *Sap* is imbib’d, and distributed to the
several *Parts*. 15. §. THE ROOT standing in the *Ground* thus prepared, and being
always surrounded with a *Barque*, which consisteth chiefly of a
*Parenchymous* and *Spongy* Body;⁠[3] it will thus, as *Sponges* do, naturally
suck up the watry parts of the *Soil* impregnate with the said
*Principles*. Which *Principles* notwithstanding, being in proportion
with the watry parts, but few, and also more *Essential*;⁠[4] therefore
in this *Parenchymous Part*, are they never much discovered, either by
*Colour*, *Taste*, or *Smell*. As it is probable, that some distilled *Waters*,
which discover nothing, to Sense, of the *Plants* from which they are
distilled, may yet, in part, retain their *Faculties*. And it is known,
that many Bodies; as *Crocus Metallorum*, convey many of their parts
into the *Menstruum*, without any sensible alteration thereof. So *Frost*
and *Snow* have neither *Taste* nor *Smell*; yet from their *Figures*, ’tis
evident, that there are divers kinds of *Saline Principles* incorporated
with them; or at least, such *Principles* as are common to *them* and
divers kinds of *Salts*.

[3]
 *P. 1. c. 3. §. 3.*

[4]
 *§. 11, 12.*

16. §. The entrance of this Impregnate Water or *Sap* is not without
difference, but by the Regulation of the intervening *Skin*; being
thereby *strained* and rendred more pure: the *Skin*, according to the
thickness⁠[5] or closeness thereof, becoming sometimes only as a *brown
paper*, sometimes as a *Cotton*, and sometimes as a *Bag* of *Leather* to
the transient *Sap*, as the nature of it doth require. By which it is also
*moderated*, lest the *Barque*, being spongy, should suck it up too fast,
and so the *Root* should be, as it were, surcharged by a *Plethora*. And
divers of the *Succiferous Vessels* being mixed herewith⁠[6] and lying
next the Soil, usually more or less *mortified*, and so their *Principles*
somewhat *resolved*; the *Sap* is hereby better *specified*, and further
*tinctured*; such parts of the *Sap* best entring, as are most agreeable to
those *Principles*; which the *Sap* also carries off, in some part, as it
passeth into the *Barque*.

[5]
 *P. 1. c. 2. §. 1.*

[6]
 *P. 1. c. 2. §. 4.*

17. §. The *Sap* thus *strained*, though it be *pure*, and consisteth of
*Essential* parts; yet being *compounded* of *heterogeneous* ones; and received
into the *Parenchyma* of the *Barque* a laxe and spongy Body, they
will now easily and mildly *ferment*. Whereby they will be yet further
prepared, and so more easily insinuate themselves into all the
*Bladders* of the said *Parenchyma*; swelling and dilating it as far as the
*Continuity* of its parts will bear. Whereupon, partly from the continued
entrance of fresh *Sap*, and partly by a Motion or Pressure of *Restitution*
in the swollen and Tensed *Bladders* of the *Parenchyma*, the
*Sap* is forced thence into the other parts of the *Root*.

18. §. And because the *Parenchyma* is in no place openly and
Visibly Pervious, but is every where composed of an Infinite Number
of small *Bladders*⁠[7]; the *Sap*, therefore, is not only *fermented* therein,
and fitted for Separation; but, as it passeth through it, is every part
of it, *strained* an Hundred times over, from *Bladder* to *Bladder*.

[7]
 *P. 1. c. 3. §. 4.*

19. §. The *Sap* thus *fermented*, and *strained*, is distributed to the
other *Organical Parts*, according as the several *Principles* of This, are
agreeable to those whereof the said *Organical Parts* consist. As the *Sap*
therefore passeth from *Bladder* to *Bladder*, such *Principles* as are agreeable
to those of the *Fibres* of the said *Bladders*, will adhere to, and insinuate
themselves into the Body of the *Fibres*; *sc.* *Watry* chiefly,
next *Acid*, then *spirituous*, *Earthy*, *Aery*, and *Oleous*.⁠[8]

[8]
 *Idea, §. 50, 52.*

20. §. And the *Sap* by its continual appulse and *percolation*, as it
leaveth some parts upon the said *Fibres*; so as it is *squeezed* betwixt
them from *Bladder* to *Bladder*, it licks and carries off some others from
them, in some *union* together with it; and so is *Impregnate* herewith:
as *Water*, by passing through a *Mineral Vein*, becomes *tinctured* with
that *Mineral*.

21. §. The *Sap* thus *Impregnate* with some *united Principles* of the
*Parenchymous Fibres*, passeth on to the *Lignous Vessels*, whereinto their
correspondent *Principles* also enter; *sc.* *Watry*, *Saline*, *Oleous and Earthy*
chiefly.⁠[9] And because the *Parenchymous Principles* mixed with
them, are in some degree *united*, and so more ready to *fix*; some of
these therefore will likewise enter into the said *Vessels*. Whereupon, the
*Alkali oleosum* of the one, and the *Acidum spirituosum* of the other, meeting
together; These, with the other *Principles*, all *concentre*, and of
divers *fluids*, become one *fixed* Body, and are gradually *agglutinated* to
the *Vessels*; that is, The *Vessels* are now *nourished*.

[9]
 *Idea, §. 51, 52.*

22. §. The supply of the *Sap* still continued, the *Principles* thereof
will not only enter into the *Body* of these *Parts*, but also their *Concaves*.
And the *Parenchymous Fibres* being *wrapped* about the *Vessels*,⁠[10] as
often as the said *Fibres* are more *turgid* with their own contained *Fluid*,
they will thereby be somewhat *shortned*, or contract in length; and so
must needs *bind* upon the *Vessels*, and thereby, as it were, *squeeze* some
part of the *Fluid*, contained both within themselves and the *Vessels*,
back again into the *Bladders*.

[10]
 *P. 1. c. 5. §. 12.*

23. §. And the *Sap* herein, being thus *tinctured* with some of the
*united Principles* of the *Vessels*, divers of them will now also insinuate
themselves into the *Parenchymous Fibres*, and be incorporated with
them: Whereby, the said *Fibres*, which before were only *relaxed* and
*dilated*, are now also *nourished*, and not till now. Some portion of
the *united Principles* both of the *Parenchymous* and *Lignous Parts*, being
necessary to the true *nutrition* of Each: As the Confusion and
joynt assistance of both the *Arterious* and *Nervous Fluids*, is to the
nourishment or coagulation of the *Parts* in *Animals*.

24. §. Some portion of the *Sap* thus doubly *tinctured*, is at the
same time transmitted to, and enters the *Body* of the *Aer-Vessels*; consisting
chiefly of *Water*, *Aer*, and *Acid*; and, in like manner, as in the
other *Parts* is herein *agglutinated*. And the appulse and pressure of the
*Sap* still continued, some portion hereof is also trajected into the *Concaves*
of the said *Vessels*; existing therein as a most *Compounded Fluid*; partaking,
more or less, both of the *Principles* and *Tinctures* of the other
*Organical Parts*, and of the *Aer-Vessels* themselves; being as it were, a
*Mixed Resolution* from them all.

25. §. And the *Parenchymous Fibres* being *wrapped* about These,
as about the other *Vessels*,⁠[11] and, in like manner, *binding* upon them;
they thus frequently *squeeze* part of the said contained *Fluid* out
again: As necessary, though not to the immediate Nourishment of the
*Parts*, yet the due Qualification of the *Sap*; being a Constant *Aerial
Ferment*, successively stored up within the *Aer-Vessels*, and thence transfused
to the *Sap*, in the other *Organical Parts*.

[11]
 *P. 1. c. 5. §. 12.*

26. §. And that there may be a better Transition of the *Sap* thus
*tinctured*, to the several *Organical Parts*; therefore, none of them are
close set and compact within themselves, severally: For so, they
would be inaccessible to the *Sap*, and their inward Portions, wanting
a due supply of *Aliment*, would be starved. But the *Vessels*, both of
*Aer* and *Sap*, being every where divided into *Braced* Portions, and
other *Parenchymous* Portions, filling up the spaces every where betwixt
them⁠[12]; there is therefore a free and copious communication of the
*Sap*, (and so of all the *Tinctures* successively transfused into it) from
*Part* to *Part*, and to every Portion of every *Part*: The *Parenchymous*
Portions, running betwixt the *Braces*, as the smaller *Vessels* do throughout
the *Viscera*, in *Animals*. Whereby, none of them want that
Matter, which is necessary either for their *Nutrition*, or for the good
Estate of their *Contents*, or for the due period of their Growth.

[12]
 *P. 1. c. 3. §. 13. & c. 4. §. 4, 5, 7.*

27. §. For the better *Tempering* of the several parts of the *Sap*,
serve the *Diametral* Portions of the *Parenchymous Body* which run sometimes
directly through the *Barque*, as in *Lovage*, *Parsley*, &c. is described
and figur’d⁠[13] Which being, all or most of them, continued betwixt
both the *Succiferous* and the *Aer-Vessels*, from the Circumference

to the Centre; they hereby carry off a more Copious and *Aerial
Ferment* from the One, and communicate it unto the Other. For as
the *Sap* enters the *Barque*, the more *liquid* part, still passeth into the
*succulent* Portions thereof; the more *Aery*, is separated into those
White and Dryer *Diametral* ones; and in its passage betwixt the *Portions*
of the *Aer-Vessels*, is all along communicated to them. Yet is it not a
pure or *simple Aer*, but such as carries a *Tincture* with it, from the *Succiferous
Vessels*. And therefore it is observable, That when the *Diametral*
Portions are more distant, the *Sap-Vessels* run not in a Straight Line betwixt
them, but are Reciprocally so inclined, as to touch upon them;
as in *Lovage* is visible: Thereby communicating their *Tincture* to the
*Aer*, as it passeth by them, through the said *Diametral* Portions.

[13]
 *P. 1. c. 3. §. 7, 8.*

28. §. By the continual appulse of fresh *Sap*, some, both of the
*aery*, and of all the other parts thereof are transmitted into the *Pith*;
where, finding more room, it will yet more kindly be *digested*. Especially
having the advantage herein of some degree of Warmth; being
herein remoter from the *Soil*, and, as it were, *Tunn’d* up within
the *Wood*, or the *Mass* of surrounding *Vessels*. So that the *Pith* is a
*Repository* of better *Aliment* gradually supplied to those *Succiferous
Vessels*, which are frequently scattered up and down therein, and
which ascend into the *Trunk*.⁠[14] But where no *succiferous Vessels* are
mixed, herewith, it usually becomes Dryer, and is replenished with a
more *Aerial* and *Warmer Sap*; whereby the growth of the *Caulis* is
promoted, as by an *Hot Bed* set just under it. And in many *Plants* with
divers knobbed *Roots*, the younger are more succulent, serving chiefly
to feed the *Stalk*: the Elder are spongy and fill’d with *Aer*, for the fermenting
of the *Sap*, and more early growth of the *Stalk*: as in little
*Celandine*, *Dogstones* and all of that Kindred. And thus all the *Parts*
have a fit *Aliment* provided for their *Nourishment*.

[14]
 *P. 1. c. 5. §. 3.*

How the several Parts are Nourish’d and Form’d. 29. §. IN THIS *Nourishment*, the *Principles* of the *Sap* are, as is
said, *concentred* and *locked* up one within another:⁠[15] Whence it is,
that the *Organical Parts*, being cleansed of their *Contents*, have none of
them any *Taste* or *Smell*, as in the *Piths* of *Plants*, *Paper* and *Linen
Cloth* is evident.⁠[16] Because till by *Digestion*, violent *Destillation*, or
some other way, they are resolved, they cannot act upon the *Organs*
of those Senses. For the same reason, they are never *tinctured*, excepting
by their *Contents*: and although, to the bare Eye, they frequently
shew *White*, yet viewed through a *Microscope*, they all appear
*transparent*. In like manner, as the *Serum* of *Blood*, *Whites* of *Eggs*,
*Tendons*, *Hairs* and *Horns* themselves are *transparent*, and without
much *Smell* or *Taste*, their *Principles* being, in all of them, more or
less *concentred*: But when ever these *Principles*, are forcibly *resolved*,
they are ever variously invested with all those *Qualities*.

[15]
 *§. 21.*

[16]
 *Idea, §. 49, 51.*

30. §. And as from the *Concentration* of the *Principles*, in every
*Organical Part*, the said *Parts* do thus far, all agree: So, from the
*Predominion* of the *Principles* of each *Part*, the rest are controuled,
not only to a *Concentration*, but an *Assimilation* also; whereby, the
*Specifick Differences*, of the several *Organical Parts*, are preserved.
Hence the *succiferous Vessels* are always *Tough* and very Pliable; for so
are all *Barques*, wherein these *Vessels* abound; so is a Handful of *Flax*,
which is nothing else but a heap of the *succiferous Vessels* in the *Barque* of

that *Plant*. For besides *Water*, and *Earth*, an *Alkaline Salt* and *Oyl* are,
as is said, the predominant *Principles* of these *Vessels*.⁠[17] It is then the
*Oyl*, chiefly, by which these *Vessels* are *Tough*: for being of a tenacious
Nature, by taking hold of other *Principles*, it marries them together;
and the *Alkaline Salt* and *Earth*, *concentred* with it, addeth to it
more *Strength*. Hence the *Caput Mortuum* of most Bodies, especially
those that abound with *Oyl* and a *Sal Alkali*, is *brittle* and *friable*;
those *Principles*, which were the *Ligaments* of the rest, being forced
away from them. From the same Cause, the *Parenchymous Parts* of a
*Root*, even in their Natural State, are *brittle* and *friable*; *sc.* Because
their *Earthy*, and especially *Oleous* and *Saline Principles* are, as is said,⁠[18]
so very few. Therefore all *Piths* and more *simple Parenchyma’s*, break
*short*, so *Corn*, and the *Roots* of *Potato’s*, and divers other *Plants*,
being dryed, will easily be rub’d to *Meal*; and many *Apples*, after
Frosts, eat *mealy*; the *Parenchymous Parts* of all which, are not only
by *Analogy*, but in Substance or Essence, the self same Body.⁠[19]

[17]
 *§. 21.*

[18]
 *§. 19.*

[19]
 *Lib. 1. c. 7. §. 14.*

31. §. And as the *Consistence* of the several *Organical Parts*, is dependent
on their *Principles*; so are their *Figures*. And first, the
*Succiferous Vessels*, from their *Alkaline Salt*,⁠[20] grow in Length. For
by that Dimension, chiefly, This *Salt* always *shoots*: And being a less
moveable *Principle* than the rest, and so apt more speedily to *fix* or
*shoot*: It thus overrules them to its own *Figure*. And even as the Shape
of a *Button* dependeth on the *Mould*, the *Silk* and other Materials
wrought upon it, being always conformable thereunto: so here; the
*Salt* is, as it were, the *Mould*; about which, the other more passive
*Principles* gathering themselves, they all consort and fashion to it.
Hence also the same *Sap-Vessels* are not *pyramidal*, as the *Veins* of *Animals*;
but of an equal bore, from end to end; the *shootings* of the
said *Salt*, being also figured more agreeably to that *Dimension*. And
as by the *Saline Principle*, these *Vessels* are *Long*; so by the *Oleous*,⁠[21]
they are every where *Round*, or properly *Cylindrical*; without some
joynt Efficacy of which *Principle*, the said *Vessels* would be *Flat*, or
some way Edged and *Angular*, as all *saline shoots*, of themselves, are;
as those of *Alum*, *Vitriol*, *Sal Ammoniac*, *Sea Salt*, *Nitre*, &c. And
because the *Spirituous* and more *Fluid* part of the *Principles*, is least
of all apt to *fix*; while therefore, the other parts fix round about,
This will remain moveable in the *Centre*; from whence every *Vessel* is
formed, not into a *solid*, but *hollow Cylinder*; that is, becomes a
*Tube*.

[20]
 *P. 2. §. 21.*

[21]
 *Ib.*

32. §. The *Lactiferous Vessels* are *tubulary*, as the *Lymphæducts*,
but of a somewhat wider *Concave* or *Bore*. For being their *Principles*
are less *Earthy* and *Oleous*, and also more loosely *Concentred*; as
from their easie corruption or *Resolution* by the *Aer*, it appears they
are: they are therefore more tender, and so more easily dilative, and
yielding to the said *Spirituous* part in the Centre. And by this means,
obtaining a wider *Bore*, they are more adapted to the free motion of
the *Milky Content*: which being an Oleous and Thicker *Liquor*, than
that in the *Lympheducts*; and having no advantage of *pulsation*, as the
*Blood* hath in *Animals*; might sometimes be apt to stagnate, if the
*Vessels*, through which it moves, were not somewhat wider.

33. §. As the *Saline Principle* is the *Mould* of the *Succiferous*, so
is the *Aerial* of the *Aer-Vessels*.⁠[22] Now the Particles of *Aer* strictly so
called, at least of that part of it concerned in the Generation of the
*Aer-Vessels*, I suppose, are crooked: and that by composition of many
of those crooked ones together, some of them become Spiral, or of
some other winding *Figure*: and that thereupon dependeth the *Elastick*
Property of the *Aer*, or its being capable of *Rarefaction* and
*Condensation* by force. Wherefore, the said *crooked* Particles of the
*Aer*, first *shooting* and *setting* together, as the *Mould*, the other *Principle*
cling and *fix* conformably round about them. So that, as by
force of the *Saline Principles*, the rest of them are made to *shoot* out
in *Long continued Fibres*; so by force of the *Aerial*, those *Fibers* are
still disposed into *Spiral Lines*, thus making up the *Aer-Vessels*. And
according as there are fewer of these *Aerial* Particles, in proportion to
the *Saline*, the *Concave* of the *Aer-Vessels* is variously wider, or the *Fibres*
continue their *shooting* by wider *Rings*; as those that come nearer
to a *right Line*, and so are more compliant to the *Figure* and shooting
of the *Saline* parts. And whereas the *Lympheducts*, shooting out only
in length, are never sensibly *amplified* beyond their original size:
These, on the contrary, always, more or less, enlarge their *Diameter*;
because their *Fibres*, being disposed into *Spiral Lines*, must needs
therefore, as they continue their growth, be still dilated into greater
and greater *Rings*. And being at the bottom of the *Root* more remote
from the *Aer*, and so having somewhat fewer Particles purely
*Aerial*, there ingredient to them, then at the top; they fall more under
the government of the *Saline*, and so come nearer to a *right Line*,
that is into greater *Circles*; and so the *Aer-Vessels*, made up of those
*Circles*, are there generally wider.⁠[23]

[22]
 *P. 1. c. 4. §. 23.* & *P. 2. §. 24.*

[23]
 *P. 1. c. 4. §. 16.*

34. §. By mediation of their *Principles*, the *Parenchymous Parts*
likewise of a *Root* have their proper *Contexture*. For from their *Acid
Salt* they are *Fibrous*; from their *Oyl*, the *Fibres* are *Round*, and
in all parts even within themselves; and from their *Spirit*, it is most
probable, that they are also *hollow*. But because the *Spirit* is, here,
more copious than the *Aer*; and the *Saline Principle* an *Acid*,⁠[24]
and so, more under the government of the *Spirit*, than is an *Alkali*;
therefore are not the said *Fibres* continued in *straight Lines*, as the
*Sap-Vessels*; or by one *uniform* motion, into *spiral* lines, as the *Fibres*
in the *Aerial*; but *winding*, in a circular manner, to and fro a *thousand
ways*, agreeable to the like *motions* of the *Spirit*, that most *active*,
and here most *predominant Principle*. And the *Spirituous Parts* being,
as is said, here more copious and redundant, they will not only suffice
to fill up the Concaves of the *Fibres*, but will also gather together
into innumerable little spaces, without them: whence the *Fibres*
cannot wind close together, as Thred, in a *Bottom* of Yarn; but
are forced to keep at some distance, one parcel from another, and
so are disposed, as Bread is in baking, into *Bladders*.⁠[25]

[24]
 *§. 19.*

[25]
 *P. 1. c. 3. §. 4.*

35. §. And the *under Fibres* being *set* first, as the *Warp*, the *spirituous*
parts next adjacent, will incline also to *fix*, and so govern an
*over work* of *Fibres*, wrapping, as the *Woof*, in still smaller Circles
round the other: whereby they are all knit together.⁠[26] For the
same reason, the *Lympheducts*, being first formed, the *Parenchymous
Fibres set* and *wrap* about These also.⁠[27] And the *Aer-Vessels* being

formed in the Center, the *succiferous* run along those likewise (as *volatile
Salts shoot* along the sides of a Glass, or *Frost* upon a Window)
and so are, as it were, Incrustate about them in a *Ring*.

[26]
 *P. 1. c. 5. §. 9.*

[27]
 *P. 1. c. 5. §. 12.*

How the several *Parts* come to be Situate or Dispos’d.
    36. §. SOME OF THE more Ætherial and Subtile parts of the *Aer*,
    as they stream through the *Root*, it should seem, by a certain *Magnitisme*,
    do gradually dispose the *Aer-Vessels*, where there are any store
    of them, into *Rays*. This Attraction (as I take leave to call it) or
    *Magnetick power* betwixt the *Aer* and these *Vessels*, may be argued,
    From the nature of the *Principles* common to them both: From the
    *Electral* nature of divers other Bodies; the *Load-stone* being not the
    only one which is attractive: And from other Effects, both before⁠[28]
    and hereafter mentioned. Wherefore in the inferiour parts of the
    *Root*, they are less Regular;⁠[29] because more remote from the *Aer*.
    And in the upper parts of many *Roots*, as *Cumfery*, *Borage*, *Parsnep*,
    where those that are next the Centre are confused, or differently
    disposed; *Tab. 7, 8, 9.* those next the *Barque*, and so nearer the *Aer*, are postured
    more Regularly, and usually into *Rays*. For the same reason it
    may be; that even the *Sap-Vessels* in the *Barque*, as often as the *Aer
    Vessels* are more numerous, are usually disposed into *Rays*, as following
    the direction of the *Aer-Vessels*. And that the *Parenchyma* of the
    *Barque*, is disposed into *Diametral Portions*: and that where the *Aer
    Vessels* are fewer or smaller, these *Portions* are likewise smaller or none;
 *Tab. 7, 8, 9.*, &c.
    as in *Chervil*, *Asparagus*, *Dandelion*, *Orpine*, *Bistort*, *Horse-Radish*,
    *Potato’s*, &c.

[28]
 *Lib. 1. c. 2. §. 25. & c. 4. Append. §. 2, 3.*

[29]
 *P. 1. c. 4. §. 10.*

37. §. The said Ætherial parts of the *Aer*, have a Power over
the *Aer-Vessels* not only thus to Dispose them; but also to Sollicite
and *spread* them abroad from the Center towards the Circumference
of the *Root*. By which means, those *Roots* which have no *Pith* in
their lower parts, obtain one in their upper.⁠[30] And the same *Pith*,
which in the lower part, is ratably, small, in the upper, is more or
less enlarged.⁠[31]

[30]
 *P. 1. c. 5. §. 1.*

[31]
 *Ib. §. 4.*

38. §. The *Spreading* of these *Vessels* is varied, not only according
to the *Force* the *Aer* hath upon them, but also their own greater
or less *Aptitude* to yield thereto. As often therefore, as they are Slenderer,
they will also be more Pliable and recessive from the Centre,
towards the Circumference. Hence, in such *Roots* where they are
small, they stand more distant; *Tab. 2, & 6.* as in *Turnep*, *Jerusalem Artichoke*, *Potato’s*,
and others; and so their *Braces* are fewer: and in the same
*Root*, where they are smaller, their distance is greater. Besides, in
these smaller *Aer-Vessels*, the *Rings* being less, and the *Spiral Fibres*
whereof they are made, continuing to *shoot*; the said *Rings* therefore,
must needs be so many more, as they are smaller; and so take up more
space by the length of the *Root*; and so, not being capable of being
crowded in a *right line*, every *Vessel* will be forced to recede to a *crooked*
or *bowed* one.

39. §. The *Sap Vessels*, being by the *Parenchymous Fibres* knit to *these*,
will likewise comply with Their motion, and spread abroad with them.
Yet being still smaller⁠[32] and more pliable than the *Aer-Vessels*, and so
more yielding to the intercurrent *Fibres* of the *Parenchyma*, their
*braced Threds* will, sometimes, be much more divaricated, than those
of the *Aer-Vessels*; *Tab. 6.* as in *Jerusalem Artichoke*. And because the *Succiferous*

*Vessels*, although they are joyned to the *Aerial* by the *Parenchymous
Fibres*,⁠[33] yet are not continuous with them; neither fall under
the like *Attractive Power* of the *Aer*, as the *Aerial* do; the *Aerial*
therefore, upon their spreading, do not always carry all the *Succiferous*
along with them; but often, if not always, leave many of them
behind them sprinkled up and down the *Pith*; *Tab. 6.*
 as in *Parsley*, *Carrot*,
*Jerusalem Artichoke*, *Turnep*, &c. may be seen.

[32]
 *P. 1. c. 3. §. 16.*

[33]
 *P. 1. c. 5. §. 12.*

40. §. The *spreading* of the *Aer-Vessels* still continued, several
of them, at length, break forth beyond the circumference of the
*Root*; and so are distributed, either in the lower parts, into *Branches*
and *Strings*; or at the top, into *Leaves*. And lest they should all
spread themselves into *Leaves*, and none be left for the *Caulis*; as
where they are very small, or the *Sap-Vessels* to bound them, are but
few, they might; therefore divers of them are, oftentimes, more frequently
*braced* in the Centre; *Tab. 6.* for which reason, they cannot so easily
separate and spread themselves from thence, but run more inwardly up
into the *Caulis*, as in *Borage*.

How the whole *Root* is differently sized and shaped.
41. §. FROM THE various *Sizes*, *Proportions*, and *Dispositions*
of the Parts, *Roots* are variously *sized*, *shaped*, *moved* and *aged*. Those
which, by their Annual Growth, are large; have fewer, both *Aerial*,
and *Sap-Vessels*, and a more copious *Parenchyma*. So that the *Aer-Vessels*,
or rather, the *Aery Ferment* contained in them, *volatilizing*
only a smaller portion of the *Sap*; the said *Sap* is less capable of advancement
into the *Trunk*; and so must needs remain and *fix* more copiously
in the *Root*, which is thereby more augmented. And where
the *Sap-Vessels* alone, are but few, the *Root* is yet, ratably, somewhat
large: but where they are numerous, it is never so, as to its
Annual Growth, in any proportion to their Number: Because their
*Tincture*, which is *Alkaline*, will go farther in *setting* the *Parenchymous
Parts*: than the *Tincture* of *These*, which is *Acidulate*, will go,
in *setting Them*.⁠[34]

[34]
 *P. 2. §. 31.*

42. §. When the *Aer-Vessels* are more pliable and sequent to the
Attraction of the *Aer*, and so *spread* themselves, and the *Succiferous*
together with them, more abroad; in the manner as hath been said;
the *Root* also will grow more in *Breadth*; *Tab. 2, & 7.* the nutrition of the *Parenchymous
Parts*, to which the *Vessels* are adjacent, being thus, by the
same dimension, more augmented; as in *Turnep*, *Jerusalem Artichoke*, &c. *Tab. 7, & 8.*
But where these are not spread abroad, the *Root* is but slender; as in
*Asparagus*, *Dandelion*, &c.

43. §. If the *Aer-Vessels* be contracted into, or near the Centre,
and are somewhat Large or Numerous; and the *Succiferous*, also more
copiously mixed with, or surrounding them; the *Root* grows very
Long; as do those of *Fenil*, *Vine*, *Liquirish*, &c.
 *Tab. 2, & 17.* For the *Aer-Vessels*
containing a more copious *Ferment*, it will well digest and mature the
*Sap*: Yet the *Succiferous* being over proportioned to them; the *Sap*
will not therefore, be so far volatilized, as to ascend chiefly into the
*Trunk*; but only to subserve a fuller Growth of their *Vessels*: which
being more numerous, and so more sturdy, and less sequent to the
expansive motion of the *Aerial*; this their own Growth, and consequently,
that of all the other *Parts*, cannot be so much in Breadth,
as Length.

44. §. Where the same *Aerial Vessels* are Fewer, or more Contracted,
or sheathed in a Thicker and Closer *Barque*; *Tab. 7, 8.* the *Root* is smooth, and
less *Ramified*, as in *Asparagus*, *Peony*, *Dandelion*. But where more
Numerous, sheathed in a Thinner *Barque*, Smaller, or more Dilated;
the *Root* is more *Ramified*, or more *Stringy*, *Tab. 2, & 7.* as in *Columbine*, *Clary*,
*Beet*, *Nicotian*. For being, as is said, by these means, more sequent
to the Attraction of the *Aer*; approaching still nearer the circumference
of the *Barque*, they at last strike through it, into the *Earth*.
And the *Parenchymous Fibres* being wrapped about them, and the
*Succiferous Vessels* knit to them by those *Fibres*;⁠[35] therefore they
never break forth naked, but always invested with some quantity of
these *Parts* as their *Barque*: where by, whatever *Constitutive Part* is
in the *main Body* of the *Root*, the same is also in every *Branch* or
*String*.

[35]
 *P. 1. c. 5. §. 12.*

45. §. From the same Expansion and Pliability of the *Aer-Vessels*,
the *Root* oftentimes putteth forth *Root-Buds*; which gradually shoot
up and become so many *Trunks*. In the Formation of which *Buds*,
they are pliable and recessive all kinds of ways; being not only invited
Outward, toward the Circumference of the *Root*, as in *Root-strings*,
but also spread more Abroad every way, so as to make a *Root-Bud*:
Where as in the said *Root-strings*, they are always more Contracted.
*Tab. 6.* Which, in respect of the Disposition of the *Parts*, is the
principal difference betwixt the *Root* and the *Trunk*, as hath been
said.⁠[36] Hence, those *Roots*,
chiefly, have *Root-Buds*,*Tab. 11.* which have
the smallest *Aer-Vessels*;⁠[37] these, as is said, being the most pliable
and Expansive.

[36]
 *P. 1. c. 1. §. 2, 3.*

[37]
 *P. 1. c. 4. §. 15.*

46. §. But because the expansiveness of the *Vessels*, dependeth also,
in part, upon the Fewness of their *Braces*; therefore the said *Buds*
shoot forth differently, in divers *Roots*. Where the *Braces* are fewer,
the *Buds* shoot forth beyond the Circumference of the *Root*, as in *Jerusalem
Artichoke*; *Tab. 6.* where more close, as in *Potato’s*, the *Buds* lie
a little absconded beneath it; the *Aer-Vessels* being here, by their
*Braces*, somewhat checked and curbed in, while the *Barque* continueth
to swell into a fuller Growth.

47. §. If the *Aer-Vessels* are all along more equally sized, the
*Root* is so also, or *Cylindrical*; as are those of *Eryngo*, *Horse-Radish*,
*Marshmallow*, *Liquirish*, &c. But if unequal, growing still *wider* towards
the *bottom* of the *Root*; then the *Root* is unequal also: But
groweth, as is observable, quite contrarily to the *Aer-Vessels*; not
Greater, as They do; but still smaller, or *pyramidally*; as in *Fenil*,
*Borage*, *Nettle*, *Patience*, *Thorn-Apple*, &c. is apparent. For the *Aer-Vessels*
being considerably wider about the *bottome* of these *Roots*; they
there contein a more Copious *Ferment*: Whereby the *Sap* is there
also more volatilized, and plentifully advanced to the Upper Parts.
Withal, thus receiving into themselves, and so transmitting to the upper
Parts, a more plentiful *Vapour*, they hereby rob the *Parenchymous
Parts* of their Aliment, and so stint them in their Growth.

How *Roots* are differently Mov’d.
48. §. FROM THE different *Proportions* and *Situation* of the
*Parts*, the *Motions* of *Roots* are also various. For where the *Aer-Vessels*
are spread abroad and invested with a thinner *Barque*; *Tab. 8.* the *Root* runs
or lies *Level*, as in the *level-Roots* of *Primrose*, *Bishops-weed*, *Anemone*, &c.

may be seen. So that these *Roots*, as by the *Perpendicular Strings*,
which shoot from them into the *Earth*, and wherein the *Aer-Vessels*
are contracted into their Center, they are Plucked down⁠[38]: So by
the *Aer-Vessels*, which stand nearer the *Aer*, and more under its Attractive
Power⁠[39] they are invited *upwards*; whereby they have
neither *ascent* nor *descent*, but keep *level*, betwixt both.

[38]
 *P. 1. c. 1. §. 15.*

[39]
 *P. 2. §. 36.*

49. §. But if these *Vessels* are Contracted, standing either in, or
near the Centre, and are invested with a *Barque* proportionably
Thick; the *Root* striketh down *perpendicularly*, as doth that of *Dandelion*,
*Bugloss*, *Parsnep*, &c. *Tab. 7, 8.* And therefore the said *Vessels*, although
they are spread abroad in the *level Roots*, yet in the *perpendicular* ones
of the same *Plant*, they are always contracted; as by comparing the
*Level* and *Down-right Roots* of *Ammi*, *Primrose*, *Jerusalem Artichoke*,
*Cowslip*, and others, is manifest.

50. §. If the *Aer-Vessels* are Contracted, and Environed with a
greater number of *Succiferous*, the *Root* grows *deep*; that is, *perpendicular*
and *long*.⁠[40] *Perpendicular*,
from the Contraction of the *Aer-Vessels*;⁠[41]
and *long*, from the Predominion of the *Succiferous*, which
in their growth, are extended only by that Dimension, as in *Liquirish*,
*Eryngo*, &c.

[40]
 *P. 1. c. 1. §. 9.*

[41]
 *P. 2. §. 49.*

51. §. If the *Succiferous* are over proportioned to the *Parenchymous
Parts*, but under to the *Aer-Vessels*; the *Root* is *perpendicular* still, but
groweth *shallow*: The *Succiferous* being sturdy enough to keep it *perpendicular*;
 *Tab. 7.*
But the *Aer-Vessels* having a predominion to keep it from
growing *deep*; as in *Stramonium*, *Nicotian*, *Beet*, &c.

52. §. If, on the contrary, the *Parenchymous Parts* are predominant
to the *Aer Vessels*; and that, both in the *Root* and *Trunk*; then the
whole *Root* changeth place, or *descends*.⁠[42] For the said *Aer-Vessels*,
having neither in the *Trunck*, nor in the *Root*, a sufficient Power to
Draw it *upwards*; it therefore gradually yields to the Motion of its
*String-Roots*; which, as they strike into the Soil, Pluck it down after
them. And because the old *Strings* annually rot off, and new ones
successively shoot down into the *Ground*, it therefore annually still descendeth
lower; as in *Tulip*, *Lily*, &c. may be observed.

[42]
 *P. 1. c. 1. §. 10. Lib. 1. c. 2. §. 25,*
 and *4. Append. §. 10. P. 2. §. 36.*

53. §. Where the *Aer-Vessels* are much *spread* abroad, and also *numerous*,
the *Root* oftentimes, as to its several parts, *descends* and *ascends*
both at once. So *Radishes* and *Turneps*, at the same time, in which their
nether parts *descend*; their upper, (where the said *Vessels* are more
loosely *braced*, and *spread* more abroad than in the lower parts) *Tab. 2.* do
*ascend*, or make their Growth *upward*. Hence also, the upper part
of most young *Roots* from *Seed*, ascends: Because the first *Leaves*, being
proportionably large, and standing in a free *Aer*, the *Aer-Vessels*
therein, have a dominion over the young *Root*; and so themselves
yielding to the solicitation of the *Aer*, *upwards*; they draw the *Root*,
in part, after them.

How *Roots* are differently Aged.
 54. §. BY THE *Situation* and *Proportions* of the *Parts*, the *Age*
of the *Root* is also varied. For if the *Sap-Vessels* have the greatest
Proportion, the *Root*, is *Perennial*, and that to the farthest extent, as
in *Trees* and *Shrubs*. Because these *Vessels* containing a more copious
*Oyl*;⁠[43] and their several *Principles* being more closely *Concentred*,
they are less subject to a *Resolution*, that is, a Corruption or Mortification
by the *Aer*.

[43]
 *P. 2. §. 21.*

55. §. If the *Parenchymous Parts* have much the greatest, the
*Root* seldom liveth beyond Two Years; but afterwards perisheth either
in whole, or in part; as do divers *bulbous*, *tuberous*, and other
*Roots*; whether they are more Porous and Succulent, or more Close
and Dry. If Porous, all the *Liquid Principles* standing herein more
abundant, either by a stronger Fermentation, or otherwise, Resolve
the *fixed ones* of the *Organical Parts*; whence the whole *Root*, rots;
as in *Potato’s*. So also *Parsneps*, and some other *Roots*, which, in a
hard and barren *Soil*, will live several years, in another more rank,
will quickly rot. If the *Parenchyma* be Close, then the *Aer*, chiefly,
entring in and filling it up, thus mortifies the *Root*; not by Rotting the
*Parts*, but over Drying them; as in *Satyrion*, *Rape-Crowfoot*, *Monkshood*,
&c.⁠[44]

[44]
 *P. 1. c. 1. §. 13*, *16,* &
 *P. 2. §. 28.*

56. §. But if the *Aer-Vessels* have the *greatest Proportion*, and especially
if they are more *large*, and withall, are *spread* more abroad:
the *Root* is *Annual*, as in *Thorn-Apple*, *Nicotian*, *Carduus Ben*, &c.
*Tab. 9.* And of the same Kindred, if any, those are *Annual*, which have the
most *Aer-Vessels*. So *Endive* and *Sonchus*, which have store of
*Aer-Vessels*, are both *Annual*: whereas *Cichory*, in which they are fewer,
is a *Perennial Root*. For hereby a more copious *Aer* being Transfused
into all the other *Parts*;⁠[45] they are thus, by degrees, hardened,
and become sticky; and so impervious to the *Sap*, which ought
to have a free and universal Transition from *Part* to *Part*. As *Bones*,
by *Precipitations* from the *Blood*, at length, cease to grow. Or the
same more abundant *Aer*, so far *volatilizeth* the *Liquors* in the *Root*,
that they are wholly advanced into the *Trunk*, and so the *Root* is
starved. Whence also the *Aer-Vessels* of the *Trunk*; where they are
numerous, and over proportioned to the *Bulk* of the *Root*, as in *Corn*;
they so far promote the advance of the *Sap*, as to exhaust the *Root*,
sucking it into a Consumption and Death.

[45]
 *P. 2. §. 25, 26.*

How the *Contents* of the several *Parts* are made.
57. §. FROM THE *Principles* of the *Parts*, their *Contents* and
the several *Qualities* hereof are also various;⁠[46] the *Fluid* of each
*Organical Part*, being made, chiefly, by *Filtration* through the sides
thereof; such of the *Principles* in the *Sap*, being admitted into, and
transmitted through them, as are aptest thereunto. In the like manner,
as when *Oyl* and *Water*, being poured upon a Paper, the *Water* passeth
through, the *Oyl* sticks: or as the *Chyle* is strained through the *Coats*
of the *Guts*, into the *Lacteal Vessels*: or as *Water* in *Purgations*, is
strained through the *Glands* of the same *Guts*, from the *Mesenterical*.

[46]
 *Idea, §. 54.*

58. §. The *Principles* therefore of the *Parenchymous Fibres* being
*spirituous*, *acid*, and *aerial*, they will also admit the like into them;
excluding those chiefly which are *Alkaline* and *Oleous*.⁠[47] And as by
the *Conjugation* of such *Principles* in the *Fibres*, the like are capable of
*admittance* into their Body: so the *Proportion* and *Union* of the same
*Principles*, regulates the *transmission* hereof into their *Concave*. Wherefore,
the predominant *Principles* of the *Fibres* being chiefly *acid*, next
*spirituous*, and *aery*, the more *aery* ones will be *transmitted*. For if
more of *them* should *fix* they must do so by similitude and adhesion:
But where there are fewer similary parts to adhere to, fewer must adhere.
The *Fibres* therefore contain so many parts of *Aer*, as to *admit*

many more into their Body; but not to *fix* them; which therefore
must needs, upon admission, pass through into their *Concave*; where,
together with some other more *spirituous* parts, they make an *Ætherial
Fluid*. And because some *aqueous* or *vaporous* parts will also strain
through with them; hence it is, that as more and more of these enter,
they by degrees still thrust out the *aery* ones; which quitting the more
*succulent Fibres* of the *Parenchyma*, are forced to betake themselves
to the *dryer* ones, *scil.* all those, whereof the *Diametral Portions* do
consist. For the same reason the *Aery* parts being gradually excluded
the *succulent Fibres* of the *Barque*; they are forced to recede and transmigrate
into those of the *Pith*. And the *Fibres* of the *Pith* themselves
being filled, and the *Aery* parts still forced into them; they at length
also strain through the *Fibres* into the *Bladders*: whence it comes to
pass, that while the *Barque* is *succulent*, the *Pith* is often times filled
with *Aer*.

[47]
 *P. 2. §. 19.*

59. §. The *Lymphæducts* being more *earthy*, *Salinous*; *oleous*,
 and *P. 2. §. 21.*
*aqueous*, will both *admit* and copiously *fix* the like *Principles*, as their
proper Aliment. The *Water* being more *perfluent* than the rest, will
therefore strain, with a lighter *Tincture* of them, into their *Concave*.
Especially the *Oleous* parts of these being *rampant*, and less apt to *fix* and
*seize* the *aqueous*, upon their entrance, than the *saline*.

60. §. The *Lactiferous*, appearing to be made, chiefly, by the
Constipation of the *Parenchymous Parts* all round about their Sides;
the *Liquor* conteined in those *Parts*, although it may easily enough
be transfused into the Hollow of these *Vessels*; yet seems it not, with
equal facility, to be refunded thence: So that the *thinner* and more
*aqueous* Portion only, passing off; the remainder, is, as it were, an
*Oleous Elixyr*, or extract, in the form of a *Milk*.

61. §. The *Fluid Ferment* contained in the *Aer-Vessels*, is also in
part, dependent on the *Principles* of those *Vessels*, being in their percolation
*tinctured* therewith. But because the percolation is not made
*through* the *Body* of the *Fibres* whereof the *Vessels* are composed, but
only *betwixt* them; therefore the transient *Principles* more promiscuosly,
yet with an over porportion of dryer Particles, pass into the *Concaves*
of these *Vessels*, and so are herein all immersed in a Body of
*Aer*.⁠[48] The *Fibres* themselves, in the mean time, as those of the
*Parenchyma*, admitting and containing a more *Aery* and *Ætherial
Fluid*.

[48]
 *P. 2. §. 24.*

62. §. The *Contents* are varied, not only by the *Nature*, but also
the *Proportion* and *Situation* of the *Parts*, whereby the said *Contents*
are with different Facility and Quantity, communicated one to another.
Hence it is, partly, that a *Vine*, or that *Corn*, hath so little *Oyl*: *sc.*
Because their *Aer-Vessels*, in proportion with the other *Parts*, are so
*Great* and *Numerous*: in *Corn*, the *Stalk* being also very hollow, and so
becoming as it were, one Great *Aer-Vessel*. For the *Oily* parts of the *Sap*,
are so exceedingly *attenuated*⁠[49] by the *Aery Ferment* contained in
these *Vessels*; that they are, for the most part, so far *immersed* in the
*Spirit*, or mixed therewith, as not, by being collected in any considerable
Body, to be distinguishable from it. And the affinity that is betwixt
*Spirits* and *Oils*, especially *Essential*, is manifest: Both are very
inflammable; Both will burn all away; The *Oders*, which we call
the *Spirits* of *Plants*, are lodged in their *essential Oyl*; Both, being

duly *Rectified*, will mix as easily together, as *Water* and *Wine*. So
that, although *Oyl*, by the separation of its *earthy* and *Saline* parts,
which give it its sensibly *oleous* Body, may not be so far *attenuated*, as to
*produce* a *Spirit*; yet that it may so far be attenuated, and so be mixed
therewith, as *not to be discerned from it*, as in the forementioned *Plants*,
will be granted.

[49]
 *P. 2. §. 25,* & *56.*

63. §. Hence it is, that the *Lactiferous* standing more remote from
the *Aer-Vessels*, and the *Succiferous* interposing;⁠[50] the *Liquor*, therefore,
contained in them, is not so much under the government of the
*Aerial Ferment*, and is thence, partly, more *Oily*. For the same reason,
all *Roots* which are *Milky*, so far as I have observed, have an under-proportion
of *Aer-Vessels*, these being either Fewer or Smaller.

[50]
 *Tab. 9. & 16.*

How the *Odours* of *Plants* are made.
64. §. FROM what hath been said, we may receive some
information, likewise, of the *Odours*, *Colours*, and *Tastes* of
*Plants*. And for *Odours*, I suppose, That the chief Matter of them,
is the *Aerial Ferment* contained in the *Aer-Vessels*. Not but that
the *other Parts* do also yield their smell; but that *these* yield the
*strongest* and the *best*, and *immediately* perceptible in *fresh*, *undryed* and
*unbruised Plants*. For the *Aer* entring into, and passing through the
*Root*, and carrying a *Tincture*, from the several *Organical* and *Contained*
Parts, along with it, and at last entring also the *Concaves* of the
*Aer-Vessels*; it there exists the most *Compounded* and *Volatile Fluid*,
of all others in the *Plant*, and so the fittest matter of *Odour*: and
such an *Odour*, as answers to that of all the *Odorous* parts of the
*Plant*.⁠[51] Wherefore the *Organical Parts*, being well clensed of their
*Contents*, smell not at all; Because the *Principles* hereof are, as hath
been said, so far *fixed* and *concentred* together. Hence also the *Contained
Parts* themselves, or any other Bodies, as their *Principles* are any way
more *fixed*, they are less *Odorous*: So is *Rosin*, less than *Turpentine*,
and *Pitch*, than *Tar*; and many the self same Bodies, when they are
*coagulated*, less than when they are *melted*. So also *Musk*, which is
not so liquid as *Civet*, is not so strong; nor *Ambergreece*, as *Musk*:
For although it hath a more excellent smell, than *Musk* hath, yet
yieldeth it not so easily; since it is a more *fixed* Body, and requireth
some *Art* to be opened. Hence also the *Leaves* of many *Plants* lose
their *Odour* upon *rubbing*: Because the *Aer-Vessels* being thereby broken,
all their *contained odorous Fluid* vanisheth at once: which before,
was only strained gradually through the *Skin*. Yet the *fixed*
Parts themselves, upon drying, are so far altered by the *Sun* and *Aer*,
as to become resoluble, and volatile, and thence odorous.

[51]
 *P. 2. §. 24.*

How their *Colours*.
65. §. SO ALSO of their *Colours*. As whence the *Colours* of the
*Skins* are varied. For divers of the *Sap-Vessels*, together with the
*Parenchymous Parts* successively falling off from the *Barque* into the
*Skin*⁠[52] by their proximity to the *Earth* and *Aer*, their *Sulphureous* or
*Oleous Principle* is more or less *resolved*, and so produceth divers *Colours*.
So those *Roots* which turn *purple* any where within, have
usually a *blacker Skin*; the one of those two *Colours* being, by a resolution
and corruption of parts, easily convertible into the other, as
in *Cumfry*, *Thistle*, &c. So the *Milk* of *Scorzonera*, contained in
the *Vessels* of the *Barque*, upon drying, turneth into a *brown Colour*:

Wherefore the *Skin*, in which there are divers of those *Vessels*,
is of the *same*. So both the *Milk* and *Skin* of *Lovage* is of a
brownish *yellow*. But *Parsnep* hath a clearer *Sap* in all its *Vessels*, and
a whiter *Skin*. So *Potato’s*, being cut traverse, after some time out of
ground, have divers *red* specks up and down where the *Vessels* stand,
and their *Skin* is accordingly *red*.

[52]
 *P. 1. c. 2. §. 2*, *4.*

66. §. The reason, I say of these *Colours*, is the *resolution* or *reseration*
of the *Principles* of the several *Parts*, chiefly, by the *Aer*, and
a *lighter mixture* of them consequent thereupon: whereby the *Sulphureous*
or *Oyly Parts*, which were before *concentred*, are now more
or less *rampant*, discovering themselves in divers *Colours*, according as
they are diversly mixed with the other *Principles*. Hence these *Colours*
are observable, according to the nature of the *Parts wherein*
they *are*, or whereunto they are *adjacent*: So where the *Lympheducts*
doe run, there is a *Red*, or some other *Sulphureous Colour*; the *Oleous
Principles* being, as is said,⁠[53] more copious in these *Vessels*; as
in the *Bark* of *Peony*, the inward parts of *Potato’s*, &c. may be
seen. But the *Parenchymous Parts*, where more remote from the said
*Vessels*, they are usually *White*, or but *Yellow*: the *Sulphureous Principle*
of these *Parts*, being, as hath been said, but sparing.⁠[54] The
same is seen in those *Roots* which shew both *Red* and *Yellow*: those
*Parts*, principally, where the *Succiferous Vessels* run, being *Red*; but
those *Parts*, where only the *Aer-Vessels* are mixed with the *Parenchymous*,
being *Yellow*; as in *Patience*. So likewise the *pithy* part of a
*Carrot*, where the *Aer-Vessels* have very few *Succiferous* mixed with
them, is *Yellow*; but the *Barque*, where the *Succiferous* are very numerous,
is *Red*. For the same reason, many *Roots*, which are
*Whiter* in their upper parts, are *Purple* or *Reddish* in their inferiour,
as *Avens*, *Strawberry*, &c. Because those lower parts, having
lain longer⁠[55]
 under ground (these being *descending Roots*) their
*Principles* are, thereby, somewhat more *resolved*, and so the *Oleous*, *ramp*
and spread all over the rest in that *Colour*.

[53]
 *P. 2. §. 21.*

[54]
 *P. 2. §. 20.*

[55]
 *P. 2. §. 13.*

67. §. And that the *Resolution* of the *Sulphureous* and other *Principles*
is partly effected by the *Aer*, appears, In that, where the *Aer*
hath a free access to the *Succiferous Vessels*, the *Colours* are there,
chiefly produced, or are more conspicuous. So in *Potato’s*, where
the *Succiferous Vessels* are either next to the external *Aer*, as in the
*Skin*; or contiguous with the *Aer-Vessels*, as in the *Ring* within the
*Barque*; there, they produce a *Red*: but where more remote from
both, as in the middle of the *Barque*, and Centre of the *Root*,
there they produce none. Hence also it is, that the *Leaves* and
*Flowers* of some *Plants*, as *Bloodwort*, *Wood-Sorrel*, *Radish*, *Jacea*,
&c. although *Green* or *White* in the greatest portion of their *Parenchymous
Part*; yet where the *Succiferous* and *Aer-Vessels* run together,
they are of *Red*, *Blue*, and other *Colours*; the *Oleous parts*
of the *one*, being *unlocked* and *opened*, by the *aery* of the *other*.

How their *Tastes*.
68. §. AND LASTLY, of their *Tasts*. Most *Roots* which are
*acres* or *bitting*, have a very copious *Parenchyma* in proportion with
the *Succiferous Vessels*, as of *Arum*, *Dragon*, and others: Because the
*Saline* and other *Principles* are not so much *hot*, by any sufficient
quantity of *Sulphureous*, from those *Vessels*, in which the *Sulphur*,
as is said, is more abundant;⁠[56] but rendred rather *pungent*, from

some *Spirit* and *Aer*. But divers *Umbelliferous Roots*, especially which
abound with *Lactiferous Vessels*, are *hot*; as *Fenil*, *Lovage*, *Angelica*,
&c. Yet is it not their *Oyl* alone that makes them *hot*, but the combination
thereof with the *Saline* Parts: as is manifest, from the nature
of the *Seed* of these *Plants*; wherein, as the *Oyl* is most copious;
So being held to a Candle till they burn, constantly *spit*;
which cometh to pass, by the eruption of the *Saline* Parts: and
is the very same effect, with that which followeth upon burning of
*Serum* or *Blood*. And therefore, as these *Seeds* are more *hot*, they
also *spit* the more; So those of *Cumine*, which, though fulsom, yet
are not so *hot*, *spit* less; *Fenil* and *Dill*, which are *hotter*, more;
there being a greater quantity of *volatile Salt* contained herein.
Hence all *Essential Oyls* are *hot*, the *Spirit* and *volatile Salt*, being incorporated
herewith. And some of them will *shoot*, and crystallize as
*Salts* do, as that of *Anise*; which argues a mixture of a considerable
quantity of *volatile Salt*. As also doth the Nature of these *Oyls*, in
being amicable to the *Stomach*, *Carminative*, and sometimes *Anodyne*;
*scil.* as they kill some *fetid*, or *corrosive Acid*: for *volatile Salts* themselves
will have the like operation in some cases as these *Oyls*.

[56]
 *P. 2. §. 21.*

69. §. Many *Lactiferous Roots*, as *Taraxacum* and others of that
kind, are not so much *hot*, as *bitter*. For although by the *Lactiferous
Vessels* they are very *Oyly*; yet those *Vessels* being posited in *Rings*,
and not in *Rays*, and having no *Diametral Portions* running through
their *Barque* to the *Aer-Vessels*; *Tab. 13.* the *Acido-Aerial Parts* do hereby, although
not *mortifie*, yet so far *refract* the *saline*, lightly *binding up*
the *Oleous* therewith, as to produce a *bitter Taste*. So, many *sweet*
Bodies, upon burning, become *bitter*; the *Acid* Parts, now becoming
*rampant*, and more copiously mixed with the *Oleous*.

70. §. The *Roots*, or other Parts, of many *Umbelliferous Plants*, have
a *sweetish Taste*, as both the *Sweet*, and *Common Chervil*; both the
*Garden*, and *wild Carrot*; *Parsnep*, *Fenil*, &c. the *Saline Principles*
being *concentred* in the *Oyly*, and both of a moderate quantity with
respect to the rest. For by the *Oyly*, the *Saline* is rendred more *smooth*
and amicable; and both being moderate, they are not therefore *hot*,
as in some other *Umbelliferous Roots*; but by the predominion of the
other *Principles*, made *mild*. Hence it is, that *Sugar* it self is *sweet*,
*scil.* because it is an *Oleous Salt*; as is manifest, from its being highly
*inflammable*; its easie *dissolution* by a moderate *Fire*, without the addition
of *Water*; and in that, being melted with *Turpentine*, and
other *Oily* Bodies, it will *mix* together with them. So also the *Acid
Parts* of *Vinegar*, being *concentred* in the *Salino-sulphureous* of *Lead*,
produce a *Sugar*. Hence *Barley*, which upon *Distillation* or *Decoction*
yeildeth only an *acid*; being turned into *Mault*, becomes *sweet*. Because,
being *steeped*, *couched*, and so *fermented*, the *oleous* parts are thereby
*unlocked*, and becoming *rampant*, over the other *Principles*, altogether
produce that *Taste*. And the *Bile* it self, which, next to *Water* and *Earth*,
consisteth most of *oily* parts, and of many both *saline* and *acid* is a *bitter-sweet*.
Wherein, as some of the *Saline* and *Acid* parts, smoothed by
the *Oleous*, produce a *Sweet*: So, some of the *Oleous*, impregnated with
the *Saline*, and the *Acid*, doe hereby produce a *Bitter*.
