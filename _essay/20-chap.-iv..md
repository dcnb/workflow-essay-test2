### CHAP. IV.

### Of the PITH.

![T](images/i_drop_t_119.jpg)
HE
Third General *Part* of a *Branch* is the *Pith*.
Which though it have a different name from the *Parenchyma* in the
*Barque*, and the *Insertions* in the *Wood*; yet, as
to its *Substance*, it is the very same with them both. Whereof
there is a double evidence, *sc.* their *Continuity*, and
the sameness of their *Texture*. Their *Texture* shall be
shewed presently. As to their *Continuity*, it is to be noted,
That as the *Skin* is continuous with the *Parenchyma* of
the *Barque*; and this *Parenchyma* likewise, with the
*Insertions* in the *Wood*; so these *Insertions*
again, running through the *Wood*, are also continuous with
the *Pith*. So that the *Skin*, *Parenchyma*,
*Insertions*, and *Pith*, are all *One entire piece
of Work*; being only filled up, in divers manners, with the
*Vessels*.

2. §. The *Size* of the *Pith* is various, being not the same in any
two *Branches* here represented.*Tab. 24,
 31, 34, 35.  
22,
 29, 30, 32.  
23,
 25, 26, 35. 27.  
28.*
In *Wormwood*, *Sumach*, *Fig*, *Barbery*,
’tis very large; *sc.* betwixt 5, and 7 *Inches Diametre*, as it appears
through the *Microscope*. In *Pine*, *Ash*, *Holly*, *Walnut*, not so large;
from 3 *Inches Diameter* to 4. In *Oak*, *Apple*, *Pear*, *Hazel*, lesser, scarce
from 2, to 3. In *Damascene*, not above an *Inch* and half. And in *Elm*,
scarce an *Inch Diameter*. Note also, that of all *Plants*, both *Herbs*,
and *Shrubs*, have generally the largest *Piths*, in proportion with the
other *Parts* of the same *Branch*, as in *Sumach*, *Fig*, *Barbery*, is manifest.

3. §. It is also worth the noting, That wheras, in most *Plants*,
the *Barque* and *Wood* do both grow thicker every year: the *Pith*, on
the contrary, groweth more slender; So that in a *Branch* of one years
growth, it is apparently more ample, than in one of two; and in a
*Branch* of two, than in one of three; and so on.

4. §. The *Pith*, for the most part, if not always, in the *Branch*,
as well as the *Root*, is furnished with a certain number of *Sap-Vessels*.
They are here usually so postur’d, as to make a *Ring* on the *Margin*
of the *Pith*. Where they are more numerous, or large, they are more
evident; as in *Walnut*, *Fig*, *Pine*, and others. They are also of divers
*Kinds*, *Tab. 30, 31, 32.* answerable to those in the *Barque*; as in *Wallnut*, *Lymphæducts*;
in *Fig*, *Lacteals*; in *Pine*, *Resiniferous*.

5. §. The *Parenchyma* of the *Pith* is composed of *Bladders*. Which
are the very same with those in the *Barque*, and oftentimes in the *Insertions*
within the *Wood*. Only these in the *Pith*, are of the largest
*Size*; those in the *Barque*, of a lesser; and those of the *Insertions*
least of all: for which reason they are less obvious than in the *Pith*.

6. §. The *Bladders* of the *Pith*, though always comparatively
Great; yet are of very different *Sizes*. Being easily distinguished, even
as to their *Horizontal Area*, to *Twenty* Degrees.
 *Tab. 24, 31.* Those of *Fig*, *Barberry*,
and some others, are somewhat large. And of many *Herbs*, as

of *Thistle*, *Borage*, and others, *Tab. 39.* three times as big again; appearing in
the *Microscope*, like to the largest *Cells* of an *Hony-comb*. Those of
*Plum*, *Worm-wood*, *Sumach*, less. Of *Elm*, *Apple*, *Pear*, lesser. Of
*Holly* and *Oak*, still less. *Tab. 32.* So that the *Bladders* of the *Pith* in *Borage*
or Common *Thistle*, are of that *Size*, as to contain, within the compass
only of their *Horizontal Area*, about twenty *Bladders* of the *Pith*
of *Oak*. Wherefore one whole *Bladder* in *Thistle*, is, at least an hundred
times bigger, than another in *Oak*.

7. §. Of the *Size* of these *Bladders* of the *Pith*, ’tis also to be noted,
That it doth not at all follow the *Size* of the *Pith* it self; but is
still varied, according as Nature designeth the *Pith* for various use.
Thus, whereas the *Pith* of *Sumach*, is Larger than that of *Barberry*;
it might be thought, that the *Bladders*, whereof it is composed,
should be likewise Larger: Yet are they Three times as Small again in
*Sumach*, as they are in *Barberry*. *Tab. 24,
 34.  
26, 27.  
23, 33.* So the *Pith* of *Plum*, is far Less than
that of *Pear*; yet the *Bladders* of the former are Four or Five times
as big, as those of the latter. So the *Pith* of *Hazel* is almost Three
times as Little again, as that of *Holly*; yet the *Bladders* in *Hazel*, are
Ten times bigger, than in *Holly*.

8. §. The *Shape* of the *Bladders* hath also some Variety. For although,
for the most part, they are more round; yet oftentimes they
are angular: as in *Reed-grass*, a *Water-plant*; where they are *Cubical*;
and in *Borage*, *Thistle*, and many others, where they are *pentangular*,
*sexangular* and *septangular*.

9. §. Of the *Texture* of the *Bladders*, ’tis also to be noted, that
many times, the *Sides* of the greater *Bladders* are composed of lesser;
as is often seen in those of *Borage*, *Bulrush*, and some other *Plants*. In
the same manner, as the *Sap-Vessels*, are but greater *Fibres* made up of
lesser.

10. §. The *Pith*, though always originally composed of *Bladders*,
and so *One Entire Piece*; yet in process, as the *Plant* grows up, it hath
divers openings or *Ruptures* made in it: oftentimes very regularly, and
always for good use, and with constancy observed in the same *Species* of
*Plants*. In *Sharp-poynted Dock*, many of the *Pores* are considerably prolonged
by the length, like small *Pipes*. *Tab. 19.* In *Walnut* it shrinketh up into
transverse *Filmes* or *Membranes*; as likewise sometimes in *Spanish-Broom*.
Sometimes the *Pith* is hollow or Tubulary: either throughout the *Trunk*,
as in *Thistle*, *Endive*, *Scorzonera*, *Marsh-Mallow*: or so, as to remain
entire at every joynt; as in *Sonchus*, *Nettle*, *Teasle*; in which it is divided
as it were into several *Stories*: and divers other ways.

11. §. I SHALL conclude this discourse with a further illustration
of the *Texture* of the *Pith*, and of the whole *Plant*, as consequent
thereupon. I say therefore, (and have given some account hereof in
the *Anatomy* of *Roots*) That as the *Vessels* of a *Plant*, *sc.* the *Aer-Vessels*
and the *Lymphæducts* are made up of *Fibres*; according to what I
have in this Discourse above said; so the *Pith* of a *Plant*, or the *Bladders*
whereof the *Pith* consists are likewise made up of *Fibres*. Which
is true also of the *Parenchyma* of the *Barque*. And also of the *Insertions*
in the *Wood*. Yea, and of the *Fruit*, and all other *Parenchymous
Parts* of a *Plant*. I say, that the very *Pulp* of an *Apple*,
*Pear*, *Cucumber*, *Plum*, or any other *Fruit*, is nothing else but a *Ball
of most extream small transparent Threds or Fibres, all wrapped and

stitch’d up* (though in divers manners) *together*. And even all those
*Parts* of a *Plant*, which are neither formed into visible *Tubes*, nor into
*Bladders*, are yet made up of *Fibers*. Which, though it be difficult
to observe, in any of those *Parts* which are closer wrought and principally
in the *Insertions* of some *Trees*: yet in the *Pith*, especially of some
*Plants*, which consisteth of more open *work*, they are more visible.
Which introduceth the observation of them in all other *Parenchymous
Parts*. So in the *Pith* of a *Bulrush* of the *Common Thistle*, *Tab. 38.* and some
other *Plants*; not only the *Threds* of which the *Bladders*; but also the
single *Fibres*, of which the *Threds* are composed; may sometimes with
the help of a good *Glass*, be distinctly seen. Yet one of these *Fibres*,
may reasonably be computed to be a Thousand times smaller than an
*Horse-Hair*.

12. §. The *Fibrosity* of the *Parenchyma* is also visible in some *Woods*,
in which, it is apparently mixed with the *Lignous Parts*, not only by
*Insertions*, but *per minimas Partes organicas*. That is to say, The *Parenchymous
Fibres*, like smaller *Threds*, are either *wraped round about* both
the *Lignous* and the *Aer-Vessels*, or at least *interwoven* with them, and
with every *Fiber* of every *Vessel*: as in very white *Ash* or *Fir-Wood*, *Tab. 39.*
with an advantagious posture and light, may be observed.

13. §. WHENCE it follows, that the whole *Substance*, or all
the *Parts* of a *Plant*, so far as *Organical*, they also consist of *Fibres*.
Of all which *Fibres* those of the *Lymphæducts*, run only by the
*Length* of the *Plant*: those of the *Pith*, *Insertions*, and *Parenchyma*
of the *Barque*, run by the *breadth* or horizontally: those of the *Aer-Vessels*,
fetch their Circuit by the *Breadth*, and continue it by the
*Length*.

14. §. By which means, the said *Parenchymous Fibres*, in fetching
their *horizontal Circles*, do thus *weave*, and make up the *Bladders*
of the *Pith*, in *Open-Work*. And the same *Fibres* being thence continued;
they also *weave* and make up the *Insertions*, but in *Close-Work*.
Betwixt which *Insertions*, the *Vessels* being likewise transversly interjected,
some of the same *Fibres wrap* themselves also about these; thus
*tying* many of them together, and so making those several *Conjugations*
and *Braces* of the *Vessels*, which I have formerly described. And
as some of these *Horizontal Fibres* are *wraped* about the *Vessels*; so also
about the *Fibres*, whereof the *Vessels* are composed. By which
means it is, that all the *Fibres* of the *Vessels* are *Tacked* or *Stitched*
up close together into One Coherent Piece. *Tab. 40.* Much after the same
manner, as the *Perpendicular Splinters* or *Twigs* of a *Basket*, are, by
those that run in and out *Horizontally*. And the same *Horizontal Fibres*,
being still further produced into the *Barque*; they there compose
the same *work* over again (only not so *open*) as in the *Pith*.

15. §. SO THAT the most unfeigned and proper resemblance
we can at present, make of the whole *Body* of a *Plant*, is, To a piece
of *fine Bone-Lace*, when the Women are working it upon the *Cushion*,
For the *Pith*, *Insertions*, and *Parenchyma* of the *Barque*, are all extream
Fine and Perfect *Lace-Work*: the *Fibres* of the *Pith* running Horizontally,
as do the *Threds* in a Piece of *Lace*; and bounding the several
*Bladders* of the *Pith* and *Barque*, as the *Threds* do the several
*Holes* of the *Lace*; and making up the *Insertions* without *Bladders*, or
with very small ones, as the same *Threds* likewise do the *close* Parts of

the *Lace*, which they call the *Cloth-Work*. And lastly, both the *Lignous*
and *Aer-Vessels*, stand all *Perpendicular*, and so cross to the *Horizontal
Fibres* of all the said *Parenchymous Parts*; even as in a Piece of
*Lace* upon the *Cushion*, the *Pins* do to the *Threds*. The *Pins* being
also conceived to be *Tubular*, and prolonged to any length; and the
same *Lace-Work* to be wrought many Thousands of times over and
over again, to any thickness or hight, according to the hight of any
*Plant*. And this is the true *Texture* of a *Plant*: and the *general composure*,
not only of a *Branch*, but of all other *Parts* from the *Seed*
to the Seed.
