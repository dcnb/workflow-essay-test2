AVING
before given the *Anatomy* of *Trunks*;
I shall next proceed to see, what *Use* may be made
thereof; and principally, to explicate the manner
of their *Vegetation*. In doing which, that former
*Method*, which I used in shewing the manner of the
*Growth* of *Roots*, I shall not exactly follow. For
so, in regard the *Organical Parts* of the *Root* and
*Trunk* are the same, and consequently their *Nutrition* and *Conformation*
are effected in the same way; I should hereby be obliged to a nauseous
and unprofitable repetition of many things already said. The
*Explication* therefore of all those *Particulars*, which more especially
belong to the *Trunk*, or are more Apparent therein, and not spoken of,
or not so fully, in the former *Books*, will be my present Task. The
chief *Heads* whereof, shall be these Seven following, *viz.*
  

FIRST, the *Motion* and *Course* of the *Sap*.
  

SECONDLY, The *Motion* and *Course* of the *Aer*.
  

THIRDLY, The *Structure* of the *Parts*.
  

FOURTHLY, The *Generation* of *Liquors*.
  

FIFTHLY, The *Figuration* of *Trunks*.
  

SIXTHLY, The *Motion* of *Trunks*.
  

SEVENTHLY, And lastly the *Nature* of *Trunks* as variously fitted
    for *Mechanical Use*.
