### CHAP. IV.

### Of the Generation of Liquors.

![U](images/i_drop_u_131.jpg)
PON
the *Structure* and *Formation* of the *Parts*, dependeth
the *Generation* of *Liquors*, as was lately intimated.
The *manner* whereof I have formerly
shewed, in discoursing of the *Root*. Yet some things
I shall here further *explicate*. And *First*, what we
have formerly asserted, *sc.* That the concurrence of
two *specifically* distinct *Fluids*, is as necessary to
*Nutrition* in *Plants*, as in *Animals*. Which appears, as from divers
other considerations, so from the very *Structure* of a *Plant*: where in
all the *Organical Parts*, or the *Parenchyma* and the *Vessels*, are every
where mixed together *per minima*, that is, *per minimas partes organicas*,
or *Fiber* with *Fiber* of several *Kinds*. Every small part of a
*Tree*, or of the *Barque* of a *Tree*, being as I may say, a sort of *Linsy-Woolsey*.
So that there is not the least part of the *Sap*, which is not
impregnate with divers *Essential Tinctures*, as it is continually *filtred*
from the *Fibres* of *one Kind*, to those of another; standing every
where *woun’d* and *stitch’d* up together for the same purpose.

2. §. FROM the special *Nature* and *Structure* of the *Parts*, the
*Liquors* of *Plants* are likewise *specified*. The *Vessels* being the chief
*Viscera* of a *Plant*. For all *Liquors* in a *Plant*, are certainly made by
that *Plant*. And since the *Plant* hath no *Viscera* (so called) I would
then know, what its several *Liquors* are made by? If in the *Parenchyma*,
surely by that *Parenchyma*. If in the *Vessels*, by the *Vessels*.
And if of divers *Kinds* by divers *Kinds* of *Vessels*. So that what the
*Viscera* are in *Animals*, the *Vessels* themselves are in *Plants*. That is
to say, as the *Viscera* of an *Animal*, are but *Vessels conglomerated*: so
the *Vessels* of a *Plant*, are *Viscera drawn out at length*.

3. §. AGAIN, as the *specifying* of the *Sap* dependeth chiefly on
the special *Nature* of the *Parts*: so partly, upon the *Structure* of the
*Whole*. Whereby every *Part* is still better accomodated with its own
*Juyce*. Thus the *Aer-Vessels* are necessary, not only and barely for a
*supply* of *Aer*; but also by their *Number*, *Size*, and *Position* to *adjust*
the quantity of that *Aer*, to the government of *Nutrition*, and the *Generation*
of the *Specifick Liquors* of every *Plant*. Which is evident
from hence, in that they do not follow the *Size* of the *Plant*; but are
great and many, in some small *Plants*; and small and few, in some
others that are large. So *Vines*, and *Corn*, as we have formerly observed,
have proportionably a great number of *Aer-Vessels*, and those
very large. By which means the *Sap* is *attenuated* and less *Oyly*, and
more copiously impregnated with a *Subtle*, *Volatile* and *Winy Spirit*.

4. §. For the same reason, the *Stalk* of *Maze* or of *Indian Wheat*,
which when it is *Green* yieldeth a very sweet *Juyce*; and the *Canes*,
whereof *Sugar* (which aboundeth with a *volatile* and *inflammable Spirit*)
is made; these, I say, obtain the like over proportion of *Aer-Vessels*,
to what we see in most other *Plants*. Hence also it is, that
none of the said *Plants* have any considerable *Barque*; that so the attenuating
and subtilizing *Aer*, may have a more easie and plentiful admission
at the *Trunk* also. For which reason likewise the *Pores* of
the *Skin* of some *Canes* are, as hath been said, remarkably wide.

5. §. Hence also it is observable, that of the same *Species* or *Kindred*,
those *Plants* which have the most, and especially the largest *Aer-Vessels*;
have also the greatest abundance either of a *sweet*, or of a *winy
Liquor*. So in *Apple*; they are larger than in *Crab*; In *Warden*,
larger than in *Quince*; and in *Pear-Tree*, larger than in *Warden*. So
also in *Corin*, larger than in *Gooseberry*; and in *Vine*, larger than in
*Corin:* and so in others.

6. §. AND as the *Aer-Vessels*, by their *Multitude* and *Largeness*,
are accommodated to the better making of a *Winy Sap*: so by their *fewness*
and *smallness*, of an *Oylie*. As is remarkably seen in *Fir*, and
other *Resiniferous Trees*: these having, if not the *smallest*, yet the
*fewest Aer-Vessels* of all other *Trees*.

7. §. IF it be asked, how a *Plant* comes to have any *Oyl* at all in
any *Part*? Since we see, that the *Sap* by which the *Root* is fed, seemeth
to be nothing else but *Water*: and that many *Plants* which yield a
great deal of *stillatitious Oyl*, as *Mint*, *Rue*, and others, will yet grow
in *Water*: I say, if it be enquired how this *Water*, is made *Wine* or *Oyl*?
I answer, that there is no such matter. But that the *Oyl*, and all other
*Vegetable Principles* are actually existent in, and mixed *per minima*,
though in an extraordinary small proportion, with the *Water*. Even
as we see the distilled *Waters* of *Anise Seeds*, *Penyroyal*, and the like
to be impregnated with their own *Oyls*, which give the *Taste* and *Smell*
to such *Waters*.

8. §. Wherefore, as a certain quantity of any *Salt* may be dissolved
in *Water*; beyond which, it will not mix therewith, but remains under
its own *Form*: So is there a certain proportion of *Oyl*, though far
less, which may also be perfectly mixed with *Water*; and is certainly
so, more or less, with all the *Water* in the world. But if that proportion,
or degree of impregnation be once exceeded; the particles of
*Oyl* do then, and not till then, gather into a body, and appear under
their own *Form*.

9. §. I say therefore, that all kinds of *Vegetable Principles*, are
either in or together with the *Water*, with less difference first received
into a *Plant*. But when they are once therein; they are then *separated*,
that is to say, *filtred*, some from others, in very different *Proportions*
and *Conjunctions* by the several *Parts*; the *Watery* by one *Part*, the
*Aery* by another, the *Oyly* by another, and so the rest: and so every
*Part* is the *Receptacle* of a *Liquor*, become peculiar, not by any *Transformation*,
but only the *Percolation* of *Parts* out of the *common Mass*
or *Stock* of *Sap*. And so all those parts of the *Sap*, which are *superflous*
to any kind of *Plant*, are at the same time, discharged back by
*Perspirations*, into the *Aer*.

10. §. AND, that *Nature*, in the various *Percolations* and *Sepations*
of the *Sap*, may still the better answer her end; hence, it is, that
she carefully seeth, not only to the special *Nature* and *Proportion* of
the *Organs*, by which she doth her work; but likewise to their very
*Position*. Thus it is observable, That whereas the *Lymphæducts*, which
carry a more *Watery Liquor*, are still placed on the inner *Verge* of the
*Barque*, next to the *Aer-Vessels*: the *Lactiferous* and *Resiniferous Vessels*
of *Plants*, to whose *Oylie Liquor* a mixture of much *Aer* is incongruous;
do usually stand, neither on the inner, nor the outer verge of the
*Barque*; but in the *midle*. By which means, they are at the greatest
distance, and so most secure, from the *Aer*; either that which enters
the *Barque* at the Circumference, or from the *Wood* and *Pith*.

11. §. AND because the *Resinous Liquors* of *Plants* are more
*Oily*, than their *Milky*; their security therefore, from the approach
of the *Aer*, is yet further contrived. In that in *Pine*, and other *Resinous
Trees*, the *Diametral Insertions* are never found; or at least, not
*visible*: which yet in other *Trees*, are *conspicuous*; being those *Parts*,
whose office it is, to introduce the *Aer* from the *Aer-Vessels* into the
*Barque*.

12. §. AGAIN, the *Milky Liquors* of *Plants* being thinner than
the *Resinous*, and having a considerable quantity of *Water* mixed with
their *Oyl*; hence it is, that in *Milky Plants*, as in *Rhus*, there are a
greater number of *Lymphæducts*; and those standing nearer to the
*Milky Vessels*, than they do in *Pine* and the like, to the *Resinous*. By
which means they are better fitted to affuse their *Aqueous Parts* more
plentifully to the said *Milky Liquor*.

13. §. FROM the *Mixture* of *Watery Parts* with the *Oylie*, it
comes to pass, that whereas all *Lympha’s*, *Mucilages*, and *Rosins* are
transparent; the *Aquæ-oleous Liquors* of *Plants* are *Milky* or white,
or otherwise *Opacous*. For the same thing is the cause of the whiteness
of *Vegetable*, as of *Animal-Milk*: that is to say, a more copious
mixture of *Watery* and *Oily Parts per minima*, or into one Body. For
even the *Serous* and *Oylie Parts* of *Animal Milk*, when throughly
separated one from the other, they become very transparent. So the *Stillatitious
Oyl* of *Anise Seeds*, is most transparent and *limpid*, even as *Water*
it self: yet there is a known sort of *White Anise-Seed Water*, as it is
commonly called: that it is to say, wherein the *Oyl*, in distillation,
ariseth and is mixed more plentifully with the *Water*. And the *Water*,
wherein the stillatitious *Oyl* of any *Vegetable* is dissolved, becomes
a perfect white *Milk*; as in this *Honourable and Learned Presence*, I
have formerly had occasion to shew the Experiment.⁠[62]

[62]
 See the *Discourse* of *Mixture*

14. §. AND that the *Milky Liquors* of all *Vegetables* whatsoever,
are more *Oylie* than their *Lympha’s*, is most certain. For all those *Gums*,
which dissolve either in *Oyl* or in *Water*, as *Galbanum*, and the like,
are originally the *Milky Juyces* of *Plants*. And if you take the *Milk*
of any *Plant*, as for instance, the *Milk* of common *Sumach*, or of
any *Taste*, *Bitter*, *Astringent*, *Hot*, *Cold*, or any other whatsoever;
and having well *dryed* it, and then fired it at a candle; it will thereupon
burn with a very bright and durable flame, even like that of
*Tar* or *Turpentine* it self.

15. §. FROM what hath been said, we may likewise gather
the most genuine import of the word *Gum*, and the distinction thereof
both from a *Rosin* and a *Mucilage*. First, a *Rosin*, is originally a
*Turpentine*, or *Acidoleous Liquor*, having an exceeding small quantity
of *Watery Parts* mixed therewith; and which, for that reason, will
not be dissolved in *Water*, but only in *Oyl*. Of this kind are *Mastick*,
*Benzoine*, *Taccamahacca*, and divers others, commonly, in our *Bils* to *Apothecaries*,
called *Gums*. Yet in strict speaking they are all so many
*Rosins*.

16. §. Secondly, a *Gum*, and every *Oylie Gum*, is originally a
*Milky Liquor*, having a greater quantity of *Water* mixed with its
*Oyly Parts*; and which for that reason, will be made to dissolve either
in *Water* or *Oyl*. Of this kind are *Sagapen*, *Opopanax*, *Ammoniac*,
and others.

17. §. The third sort of *Gum*, is that which is *Unoylie*, and which
therefore dissolveth only in *Water*, as *Gum-arabick*, the *Gum* of
*Cherry-Tree*, and others such like. This *Gum*, though commonly so
called, yet is properly but a dryed *Mucilage*: being originally nothing
else but the *Mucilaginous Lympha* issuing from the *Vessels* of the *Tree*.
In like manner, as it doth from *Cumfry*, *Mallow*, and divers other
*Plants*: and even from the *Cucumer*. The *Vessels* whereof, upon cutting
cross, yield a *Lympha*, which is plainly *Mucilaginous*, and which
being well dryed, at length becomes a kind of *Gum*, or rather a
hardened *Mucilage*. In like manner, the *Gums* of *Plum-tree*, *Cherry-tree*
and the like, are nothing else but *dryed Mucilages*. Or, if we will
take the word in its widest sense, then all *Gums* are originally, either
a *Terebinth*, or a *Milk*, or a *Mucilage*.

18. §. I have likewise made divers Observations of the *Tasts*,
*Smells*, and *Colours* of *Plants*, and of their *Contents*, since those I last
published: and that both for the finding out the true *Causes* of their
*Generation*, and also the applying of them unto *Medical* and other
*Uses*. Of which hereafter.
