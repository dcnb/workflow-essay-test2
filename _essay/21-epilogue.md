## EPILOGUE

The murder of Senator Morgan, in his own private office, was never
solved. If it had occurred before the election, suspicion would
certainly have fallen upon Roderick Kinnison, but as it was it did not.
By no stretch of the imagination could anyone conceive of "Rod the
Rock" kicking a man after he had knocked him down. Not that Morgan did
not have powerful and vindictive enemies in the underworld: he had so
many that it proved impossible to fasten the crime to any one of them.

Officially, Kinnison was on a five-year leave of absence from the
Galactic Patrol, the office of Port Admiral had been detached entirely
from the fleet and assigned to the Office of the President of North
America. Actually, however, in every respect that counted, Roderick
Kinnison was still Port Admiral, and would remain so until he died or
until the Council retired him by force.

Officially, Kinnison was taking a short, well-earned vacation from the
job in which he had been so outstandingly successful. Actually, he was
doing a quick flit to Petrine, to get personally acquainted with the
new Lensmen and to see what kind of a job they were doing. Besides,
Virgil Samms was already there.

He arrived. He got acquainted. He saw. He approved.

"How about coming back to Tellus with me, Virge?" he asked, when the
visiting was done. "I've got to make a speech, and it'd be nice to have
you hold my head."

"I'd be glad to," and the *Chicago* took off.

Half of North America was dark when they neared Tellus; all of it,
apparently, was obscured by clouds. Only the navigating officers of the
vessel knew where they were, nor did either of the two Lensmen care.
They were having too much fun arguing about the talents and abilities
of their respective grandsons.

The *Chicago* landed. A bug was waiting. The two Lensmen, without an
order being given, were whisked away. Samms had not asked where the
speech was to be given, and Kinnison simply did not realize that he had
not told him all about it. Thus Samms had no idea that he was just
leaving Spokane Spaceport, Washington.

After a few miles of fast, open-country driving the bug reached the
city. It slowed down, swung into brightly-lighted Maple Street, and
passed a sign reading "Cannon Hill" something-or-other—neither of
which names meant anything to either Lensman.

Kinnison looked at his friend's red-thatched head and glanced at his
watch.

"Looking at you reminds me—I need a haircut," he remarked. "Should
have got one aboard, but didn't think of it Joy told me if I come home
without it she'll braid it in pigtails and tie it up with pink ribbons,
and you're shaggier than I am. You've got to get one or else buy
yourself a violin. What say we do it now?"

"Have we got time enough?"

"Plenty." Then, to the driver: "Stop at the first barber shop you see,
please."

"Yes, sir. There's a good one a few blocks further along."

The bug sped down Maple Street, turned sharply into plainly-marked
Twelfth Avenue. Neither Lensman saw the sign.

"Here you are, sir."

"Thanks."

There were two barbers and two chairs, both empty. The Lensmen,
noticing that the place was neatly kept and meticulously clean, sat
down and resumed their discussion of two extremely unusual infants. The
barbers went busily to work.

"Just as well, though—better, really—that the kids didn't marry each
other, at that," Kinnison concluded finally. "The way it is, we've each
got a grandson—it'd be tough to have to share one with *you*."

Samms made no reply to this sally, for something was happening. The
fact that this fair-skinned, yellow-haired blue-eyed barber was
left-handed had not rung any bells—there were lots of left-handed
barbers. He had neither seen nor heard the cat—a less-than-half-grown,
gray, tiger-striped kitten—which, after standing up on its hind legs
to sniff ecstatically at his nylon-clad ankles, had uttered a couple
of almost inaudible "meows" and had begun to purr happily. Crouching,
tensing its strong little legs, it leaped almost vertically upward. Its
tail struck the barber's elbow.

Hastily brushing the kitten aside, and beginning profuse apologies
both for his awkwardness and for the presence of the cat—he had never
done such a thing before and he would drown him forthwith—the barber
applied a styptic pencil and recollection hit Samms a pile-driver blow.

"Well, I'm a...!" He voiced three highly un-Samms-like, highly specific
expletives which, as Mentor had foretold so long before, were both
self-derogatory and profane. Then, as full realization dawned, he bit a
word squarely in two.

"Excuse me, please, Mr. Carbonero, for this outrageous display. It was
not the scratch, nor was any of it your fault. Nothing you could have
done would have...."

"You know my name?" the astonished barber interrupted.

"Yes. You were ... ah ... recommended to me by a ... a friend...."
Whatever Samms could say would make things worse. The truth, wild as it
was, would have to be told, at least in part. "You do not look like an
Italian, but perhaps you have enough of that racial heritage to believe
in prophecy?"

"Of course, sir. There have always been prophets—*true* prophets."

"Good. This event was foretold in detail; in such complete detail that
I was deeply, terribly shocked. Even to the kitten. You call it Thomas."

"Yes, sir. Thomas Aquinas."

"It is actually a female. In here, Thomasina!" The kitten had been
climbing enthusiastically up his leg; now, as he held a pocket
invitingly open, she sprang into it, settled down, and began to purr
blissfully. While the barbers and Kinnison stared pop-eyed Samms went
on:

"She is determined to adopt me, and it would be a shame not to requite
such affection. Would you part with her—for, say, ten credits?"

"*Ten credits!* I'll be glad to give her to you for nothing!"

"Ten it is, then. One more thing. Rod, you always carry a pocket rule.
Measure this scratch, will you? You'll find it's mighty close to three
millimeters long."

"Not 'close', Virge—it's *exactly* three millimeters, as near as this
vernier can scale it."

"And just above and parallel to the cheek-bone."

"Check. Just above and as parallel as though it had been ruled there by
a draftsman."

"Well, that's that. Let's get finished with the haircuts, before you're
late for your speech," and the barbers, with thoughts which will be
left to the imagination, resumed their interrupted tasks.

"Spill it, Virge!" Kinnison Lensed the pent-up thought. If Carbonero,
who did not know Samms at all, had been amazed at what had been
happening, Kinnison, who had known him so long and so well, had been
literally and completely dumbfounded. "What in hell's behind this?
What's the story? GIVE!"

Samms told him, and a mental silence fell; a silence too deep for
intelligible thought. Each was beginning to realize that he never would
and never could know what Mentor of Arisia really was.

The Secret Planet

No human had ever landed on the hidden planet of Arisia. A mysterious
space barrier turned back both men and ships.

Then the word came to Earth; "Go to Arisia!" Samms of the Galactic
Patrol went—and came back with the Lens, the strange device that gave
its wearer powers no man had ever possessed before.

Samms knew the price of that power would be high. But even he had no
idea of the ultimate cost, and the weird destiny waiting for the
