### CHAP. I.

### Of the several Sorts of SIMPLE and COMPOUNDED
Tasts; and the DEGREES of both.

![I](images/i_drop_i_145.jpg)

HAVE formerly published some Notes, concerning
*Tasts*.
 *Idea, §. 29.* & *Anat. of R. P. 2. §. 68*, &c.
Since then, I have made other *Observations*
upon the same Subject: and these have produced
further *Thoughts*. I will summ up all in giveing
an account, First, of the *Diversities*; and then,
of the *Causes* of *Tasts*, chiefly in *Plants*.

2. §. The *Diversities* of *Tasts* are so many, and
so considerable; that it seemeth strange, to see the matter treated of
both by *Philosophers* and *Physicians*, with so much scantness and defect.
For the *Subject* is not barren, but yieldeth much and pleasant *Variety*.
And doth also appear to be of great import unto *Medicine*. Besides,
it is preposterous to discourse of the *Causes* of *Tasts*, before we have
taken an account of their *Diversities*; Whereof therefore I shall in the
first place, exhibit the following *Scheme*.

3. §. TASTS may be distinguished by these Three general ways.
First, with respect to the *Sensation* it self. Secondly, with respect to
its *Duration* and *Terms*. Thirdly, with respect to its *Subject*.

4. §. The *Sensation* it self is differenced two ways, by its *Species*,
and by its *Degrees*. With respect to the *Species*, *Tasts* are *Simple*, or
*Compounded*. By *Simple Tasts*, I mean not such, as are never found in
conjunction with other *Tasts*: but the *Simple* or *Single Modes* of *Tast*,
although they are mixed with divers others in the same *Body*. As for
example, the *Taste* of a *Peppin*, is *Acidulcis*; of *Rhubarb*, *Amarastringens*;
and therefore *Compounded* in both. Yet in the *Peppin*, the *Acid*
is one *Simple Taste*, and the *Sweet* another; and so in *Rhubarb*, the
*Bitter* is one *Simple Taste*, and the *Astringent* is another.

5. §. Two faults have here been committed; the defective *Enumeration*
of *Simple Tasts*; and reckoning them indistinctly among some
others which are *Compounded*.

6. §. SIMPLE *Tasts*, (of which, properly so called, there
are commonly reckoned but Six or Seven Sorts,) are, at least Sixteen.
*First*, *Bitter*, as in *Wormwood*: to which, the contrary is *Sweet*, as in *Sugar*.
*Thirdly*, *Sower*, as in *Vinegar*: to which, the contrary is *Salt*. *Fifthly*,
*Hot*, as in *Cloves*: whereto, the contrary is *Cold*. For we may as
properly say, a *Cold Taste*, as a *Hot Taste*: there being some *Bodies*,
which do manifestly impress the *Sense* of *Cold* upon the *Tongue*, though
not by *Touch*. So doth *Sal Prunellæ*, although the *Liquor* wherein it
is dissolved, be first warmed.

7. §. *Seventhly*, *Aromatick*. For it doth not more properly agree
to an *Odor* than a *Taste*, to be *Aromatick*. And that an *Aromatick
Taste*, is distinct from an *Hot*, is clear; In that, there are many *Bodies*
of a *Hot Taste*, some meanly and others vehemently *Hot*; which yet
are not in the least *Aromatick*: as amongst others, is apparent in *Euphorbium*.
So that although an *Aromatick Taste* be often conjoyned with
*Heat*; yet it is not that *Heat* it self, but another distinct *Sense*.

8. §. *Eighthly*, *Nauseous* or *Malignant*, contrary to the former.
Such as is perceived, together with the *Astringent* and *Bitter*, in *Rhubarb*;
or with the *Bitter*, and *Sweet*, in *Aloes*. It may be called *Malignant*,
because distastful although mixed in a low degree with other
*Tasts*: whereas other *Tasts* will render one another grateful.

9. §. Again, *Tasts* may properly be said, to be *Soft* or *Hard*. A
*Soft Taste*, is either *Vapid*, as in *Watery Bodies*, *Whites* of *Eggs*, *Starch*,
*Fine Boles*, &c. Or *Unctuous*, as in *Oyls*, *Fat*, &c.

10. §. A *Hard Taste* is Fourfold, *sc.* *Penetrant*, *Stupifacient*,
*Astringent*, *Pungent*. Contrary to a *Vapid*, are *Penetrant* and *Stupifacient*.

11. §. *Penetrant*, is a kind of *Taste*, which worketh it self into the
*Tongue* (as some *Insects* into the *Skin*) without any *Pungency*; as in
the *Root* and *Leavs* of *Wild Cucumer*.

12. §. *Stupifacient*, as in the *Root* of *Black Hellebore*. Which being
chew’d, and for sometime reteined upon the *Tongue*; after a few
minutes, it seemeth to be benum’d and affected with a kind of *Paralytick
Stupor*; or as when it hath been a little burnt with eating or supping
of any thing too hot.

13. §. Contrary to an *Unctuous Taste*, are *Astringent*, and *Pungent*;
as in *Galls*, and *Spirit* of *Sal Armoniack*.

14. §. Again, *Tasts* are either *Continual*, as most commonly: or
*Intermittent*; as that of *Dracontium*, especially in the *Root*. For after
it seems to be lost and extinguished; it will then again (chiefly upon
the *Collision* of the *Tongue* and *Goomes*) be plainly heightened and reviv’d.

15. §. *Lastly*, *Tasts* are either *Still*, as usually; or may be called
*Tremulous*, as the *Heat* produced by *Pyrethrum*. *Distinct* from that
of *Cloves*, *Ginger*, and many other *Hot Bodies*, in that there the *Heat*
is *still*; but here in *Pyrethrum*, ’tis joyned with a kind of *Vibration*:
as when a *Flame* is brandished with a *Lamp-Furnace*. Thus far of the
Sorts of *Simple Tasts*.

16. §. COMPOUNDED *Tasts* are very numerous; being
made by the various *Conjunction* of *Simple Tasts*, as *Words* are of *Letters*.
Sometimes of two, as in *Saccharum Saturni*, of *Astringent* and
*Sweet*. Sometimes three, as in *Aloes*, *Malignant*, *Bitter* and *Sweet*; in
*Rhubarb*, *Malignant*, *Astringent* and *Bitter*. Sometimes four, as in
*Agarick*, *Malignant*, *Astringent*, *Bitter* and *Sweet*. And in some *Bodies*,
five or six *Species* may be joyned together.

17. §. For the more accurate *Observation* whereof, there are these
easie *Rules*. That not too many be tasted at one time: least the *Tongue*
being surcharged, become less critical. That the *Mouth* be washed
with warm water betwixt every tasting. And that those things be
first tasted which produce a less durable *Taste*; that so one may be
throughly extinguished, before another be try’d.

18. §. Of the numerous *Conjunctions* of *Tasts*, which may thus be
observed, there are only Six to which the penury of *Language* hath allowed
(if I may call them) *Proper Names*, sc. *Acerbus*, *Austerus*, *Acris*,
*Muriaticus*, *Lixivus* & *Nitrosus*. Most of which are commonly taken
in to make up the number of *Simple Tasts*. But very improperly; being
all of them *Compounded* and *Decompounded Tasts*: to which *Class*
they ought therefore to be refer’d. For

19. §. *Austere*, is *Astringent* and *Bitter*; as in the green and soft
*Stones* of *Grapes*.

20. §. *Acerb*, properly so called, is *Astringent* and *Acid*; as in
the *Juyce* of unripe *Grapes*.

21. §. *Acris*, is also *Compounded*. For first, simply *Hot*, it is not:
because there are many *Hot Bodies*, which are not *Acria*; as the *Roots*
of *Zedoary*, *Yarrow*, *Contrayerva*. Nor Secondly, is it simply *Pungent*,
because there are also *Bodies*, which are *Non-acria pungentia*; of which
kind is the *Root* of *Arum*. Wherefore *Acritude*, is *Pungency* joyned
with *Heat*.

22. §. *Muriatick*, is *Saltness* joyned with some *Pungency*, as in
common *Salt*.

23. §. *Lixivial*, is *Saltness* joyned with *Pungency* and *Heat*.

24. §. *Nitrous*, is *Saltness* joyned with *Pungency* and *Cold*.

25. §. Besides these Six, or perhaps one or two more, there are,
as is said, a great number of *Conjunctions*, for which we have no *Proper
Names*. For admit that there were but *Ten Species* of *Simple Tasts*,
*sc.* these *Ten*; *Amarus*, *Dulcis*, *Acidus*, *Salsus*, *Calidus*, *Frigidus*, *Aromaticus*,
*Malignus*, *Astringens*, *Pungens*. And of these *Ten*, but *Two*,
or at most, but *Three* to be compounded together in any one *Body*.
If only *Two*, they produce 45 *Compounded Tasts*. For the *First*, may

be compounded with all the 9 following; the *Second*, with all the 8
following; and so, the rest: which together make 45. But if the
same *Ten* be compounded by *Threes* together; they produce no less
than 120 *Variations*: as by the *Table* made of them all doth plainly
appear.

26. §. Some few of the *Conjunctions* therein set down, may not
be found actually existent in *Nature*. The abatement of which, will
be much more than compensated two ways. *First*, by the other *Six
Species* of *Simple Tasts*, which are also sometimes compounded. And by
other more complex *Conjunctions*, as of many *Quadruples*, and perhaps
some *Quintuple* or *Sextuple* ones. Thus far of the *Simple Species*,
and *Conjunctions* of *Tasts*.

27. §. THE DEGREES of *Tasts* are also numerous; and
each *Species*, in every *Conjunction*, capable of *Variation* herein. For
the more accurate observing whereof, it will be best, To take those
*Bodies*, whose *Tasts* are, as near as may be, the same in *Specie*: and
that those be first tasted, which are less strong; whereby the true *Degree*
will be more precisely taken.

28. §. The *Tasts* of *Bodies* will thus appear to be varied, in most
*Species* unto *Five Degrees*; and in some of them, unto *Ten*. So the
*Root* of *Turmerick*, is bitter in the *First Degree*; of *Gentian*, in the
*Tenth*. The *Root* of *Carduus Benedictus*, is *Hot* in the *First Degree*;
the *Green Pods* or *Seed-Cases* of *Clematis peregrina*, in the *Tenth*. So
that, allowing some to vary under *Five*; yet by a moderate estimate,
we may reckon every *Species*, one with another, to be varied by at
least *Five Degrees*. Which being added to the several *Species* of *Tasts*,
in all the *Treble Conjunctions* of the aforesaid *Table*, come to 1800 sensible
and defineable *Variations* of *Taste*. And these are the *Diversities*
of *Taste*, with respect to the *Sensation* it self.
