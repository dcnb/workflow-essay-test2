### Of the Seed in its State of Vegetation.

![B](images/i_drop_b.jpg)
EING
 to speak of *Plants*; and, as far as Inspection,
and consequent Reason, may conduct, to enquire
into the visible *Constitutions*, and *Uses* of their
several *Parts*: I choose that Method, which, to the
best advantage, may suit with what we have to say
hereon. And that is the Method of Nature her self,
in her continued Series of *Vegetations*; proceeding
from the *Seed sown*, to the formation of the *Root*, *Trunk*, *Branch*,
*Leaf*, *Flower*, *Fruit*, and last of all, of the *Seed* also to be *sown again*;
all which, we shall, in the same order, particularly speak of.

2. §. The *Essential Constitutions* of the said *Parts* are in all *Plants* the
same: But for Observation, some are more convenient; in which I shall
chiefly instance. And first of all, for the *Seed*, we choose the great *Garden-Bean*.

3. §. If then we take a *Bean* and dissect it, we shall find it cloathed
with a doubled *Vest* or *Coat*. These *Coats*, while the *Bean* is yet
green, are separable, and easily distinguished. Or in an old one, after
it hath lay’n two or three days in a mellow Soil; or been soaked as
long a time in Water:  as in *Tab. 1*. *Tab. 1. f. 2.*  When ’tis dry, they cleave so closely
together, that the Eye not before instructed, will judge them but one;
the inner *Coat* (which is of the most rare contexture) so far shrinking up,
as to seem only the roughness of the outer, somewhat resembling *Wafers*
under *Maquaroons*.

4. §. The Inner *Coat*, in its Natural State, is every where twice,
and in some places, thrice as thick, as the Outer. Next to the *Radicle*,
which I shall presently describe, it is six or seven times thicker;
and encompasses the *Radicle* round about, as in the same *Figure* appears. *Tab. 1. f. 2.*

5. §. At the thicker end of the *Bean*, in the outer *Coat*, a very
small *Foramen* presents it self, even to the bare Eye. In Dissection
’tis found to terminate against the point of that *Part* which I call
the *Radicle*. *Tab. 1. f. 1–2.*  It is of that capacity, as to admit a small *Virginal* Wyer;
and is most of all conspicuous in a green *Bean*. Especially, if a little
magnified with a good *Spectacle-Glass*. This *Foramen* is not a hole casually
made, or by the breaking off of the Stalk; but designedly formed,
for the uses hereafter mentioned. It may be observed not only in
the great *Garden-Bean*, but likewise in the other *kinds*; in the *French-Bean*
very plainly; in *Pease*, *Lupines*, *Vetches*, *Lentiles*, and other
*Pulse* ’tis also found; and in many *Seeds* not reckoned of this kindred,
as in that of *Fœnugreek*, *Medica Tornata*, *Goats-Rue*, and others:
In many of which, ’tis so very small, as scarcely, without the help of
*Glasses* to be discovered; and in some, not without cutting off part
of the *Seed*, which otherwise would intercept the light hereof.

6. §. That this *Foramen* is truly permeable, even in old *Setting-Beans*,
and the other *Seeds* above named, appears upon their being
soaked for some time in Water. For then, taking them out, and crushing
them a little, many small bubles will alternately arise and break upon
it.

7. §. Of all *Seeds* which have thick or hard *Covers*, it is also observable,
That they have the same likewise *Perforated*, as above said,
or in some other manner. And accordingly, although the *Coats* of such
*Seeds* as are lodg’d in *Shells* or *Stones*, being thin, are not visibly *perforated*;
yet the *Stones* and *Shells* themselves always are; as in *Chap. 7.*
shall be seen how. To which *Chapter*, what is farther observable, either
as to the nature and number of the *Covers* of the *Seed*, I also
refer.

8. §. The *Coats* of the *Bean* being stripp’d off, the proper *Seed*
shews it self; The parts whereof it is composed, are three; *sc.* the
*Main Body*, and two more, appendant to it; which we may call the
Three *Organical Parts* of the *Bean*.

9. §. The *Main Body* is not one entire piece, but always divided,
lengthwise, into two halves or *Lobes*, which are both joyn’d together
at the *Basis* of the *Bean*. These *Lobes* in dry *Beans*, are but difficultly
separated or observ’d; *Tab. 1. f. 2, 3.*  but in young ones, especially boil’d, they easily
slip asunder.

10. §. Some very few *Seeds* are divided, not into two *Lobes*, but
into more; as that of *Cresses* into Six. *Tab. 1. f. 4. f. 5.*  And some are not at all divided,
but entire; as the Grains of *Corn*. Excepting which few, all other
*Seeds*, even the smallest, are divided, like as the *Bean*, into just two
*Lobes*. Whereof, though in most *Seeds*, because of their minuteness,
we cannot by dissection be inform’d; yet otherwise, we easily may,
as in this *Chapter* shall be seen.

11. §. At the *Basis* of the *Bean*, the two other *Organical Parts*
stand appendent; by mediation whereof, the two *Lobes* meet and join
together. The greater of these two *Parts* stands without the two
*Lobes*, and upon divesting the *Bean* of its *Coats*, is immediately visible. *Tab. 1. f. 2. & 3* a
’Tis of a white colour, and more glossie than the *Main Body*, especially
when the *Bean* is young. In the *Bean*, and many other *Seeds*, ’tis
situated somewhat above the thicker end, as you hold the *Bean* in its
most proper posture for growth. In *Oak-Kernels*, which we call *Acorns*,
*Apple-Kernels*, *Almonds*, and many other *Seeds*, it stands prominent
just from the end; *Tab. 1. f. 6* c.  the *Basis* and the *End* being in these the
same, but in the *Bean* divers.

12 §. This *Part* is found not only in the *Bean*, and the *Seeds*
above mentioned; but in all others: being that, which upon the Vegetation
of the *Seed*, becomes the *Root* of the *Plant*; which therefore
may be called the *Radicle*: by which, I mean the Materials, abating
the Formality, of a *Root*. In *Corn*, it is that *Part*, which *Malsters*, upon
its shooting forth, call the *Come*. ’Tis not easie to be observed, saving
in some few *Seeds*, amongst which, that of the *Bean* is the most
fair and ample of all I have seen. But that of some other *Seeds*, is, in
proportion, greater; *Tab. 1. f. 7* e.  as of *Fœnugreek*, which is full as big as one of
its *Lobes*.

13. §. The lesser of the two said Appendents lies occult between
the two *Lobes* of the *Bean*, by separation whereof only it is to be seen.
’Tis enclos’d in two small *Cavities*, form’d in the *Lobes* for its reception. *Tab. 1. f. 3* b.
Its colour comes near to that of the *Radicle*; and it is founded upon the
*Basis* thereof, having a quite contrary production, *sc.* towards the *Cone*
of the *Bean*; as being that very *Part*, which, in process, becomes the
*Body* or *Trunk*, of the *Plant*. In *Corn*, it is that *Part*, which after the
*Radicle* is sprouted forth, or *come*, shoots towards the smaller end of
the *Grain*; and by many *Malsters*, is called the *Acrospire*.

14. §. This *Part* is not, like the *Radicle*, an entire Body, but divided,
at its loose end, into divers pieces, all very closely couched together,
as Feathers in a Bunch; for which reason it may be called the
*Plume*. They are so close, that only two or three of the outmost are
at first seen: but upon a nice and curious separation of these, the more
interiour still may be discovered. In the *Bean*, this may be done: but
in very few other *Seeds*; because of the extreme smallness of the *Plume*.
Now as the *Plume* is that *Part* which becomes the *Trunk* of the *Plant*,
so these pieces are so many true, and already formed, though not display’d
*Leaves*, intended for the said *Trunk*, and foulded up in the same
*plicature*, wherein upon the sprouting of the *Bean*, they afterwards appear.
In a *French Bean*, and especially in the larger white Kind, or in
the great *Indian Phaseolus*, the two outmost are very fair and elegant. *Tab. 1. f. 8* b.
In the great *Garden-Bean* two extraordinary small *Plumes* often, if not
always, stand one on either side the great one now describ’d: From

which, in that they differ in nothing save in their size, I therefore only
here just take notice of them. And these three Parts, *sc.* the *Main
Body*, the *Radicle*, and the *Plume*, are concurrent to the making up of
a *Seed*; and no more than these.

15. §. Having thus taken a view of the *Organical Parts* of the
*Bean*, and other *Seeds*; let us next examine the *Similary*, *sc.* those
whereof the *Organical* are compos’d: a distinct observation of which,
for a clear understanding of the *Vegetation* of the *Seed*, and of the whole
*Plant* arising thence is requisite: To obtain which, we must proceed
in our *Anatomy*.

16. §. Dissecting a *Bean* then, the first *Part* occurring is its *Cuticle*.
The Eye and first Thoughts, suggest it to be only a more dense and
glossy Superficies; but better enquiry discovers it a real *Cuticle*. ’Tis
so exquisitely thin, and for the most part, so firmly continuous with
the Body of the *Bean*, that it cannot, except in some small Rag, be distinctly
seen, which, by carrying your Knife aslant into the *Bean*, and
then very gently bearing upward what you have cut, will separate, and
shew it self transparent. This *Cuticle* is not only spread upon the *Convex*
of the *Lobes*, but also on their *Flats*, where they are contiguous,
extending it self likewise upon both the *Radicle* and *Plume*, and so over
the whole *Bean*.

17. §. This *Part*, though it be so far common with the *Coats* of
the *Bean*, as to be like those, an *Integument*; yet are we in a quite different
Notion to conceive of it: For whereas the *Coats*, upon setting
the *Bean*, do only administer the *Sap*, and, as being superseded from
their Office, then die; as shall be seen: this, on the contrary, with the
*Organical Parts* of the *Bean*, is nourished, augmented, and by a real *Vegetation*
co-extended.

18. §. Next to the *Cuticle*, we come to the *Parenchyma* it self;
the *Part* throughout which *the Inner Body*, whereof we shall speak anon,
is disseminated; for which reason I call it the *Parenchyma*. Not that
we are so meanly to conceive of it, as if (according to the stricter sense
of that word,) it were a meer concreted Juyce. For it is a Body
very curiously *organiz’d*, consisting of an infinite number of extreme
small *Bladders*; as in *Tab. 1.* is apparent. *Tab. 1. f. 9.*  The *Surface* hereof is somewhat
dense, but inwardly, ’tis of a laxer Contexture. If you view it
in a *Microscope*, or with a very good *Spectacle-Glass*, it hath some similitude
to the *Pith*, while *sappy* in the *Roots* and *Trunks* of *Plants*;
and that for good reason, as in *Ch. 2.* shall be seen. This is best seen in
green *Beans*.

19. §. This *Part* would seem by its colour to be peculiar to the
*Lobes* of the *Bean*; but as is the *Cuticle*, so is this also, common both to
the *Radicle* and *Plume*; that is, the *Parenchyma* or Pulp of the *Bean*, as
to its essential substance, is the same in all three. The reason why the
colour of the *Plume*, and especially of the *Radicle*, which are white,
is so different from that of the *Lobes*, which are green, may chiefly depend
upon their being more compact and dense, and thence their different
Tinctures. And therefore the *Lobes* themselves, which are green
while the *Bean* is *young*; yet when it is *old* and *dry*, become whitish
too. And in *many* other *Seeds*, as *Acorns*, *Almonds*, the *Kernels* of *Apples*,
*Plums*, *Nuts*, *&c.* the *Lobes*, even *fresh* and *young*, are pure white as
the *Radicle* it self.

20. §. But although the *Parenchyma* be common, as is said, to
all the *Organical Parts*; yet in very differing proportions. In the
*Plume*, where it is proportionably least, it maketh about three *Fifths*
of the whole *Plume*; in the *Radicle*, it maketh above five Sevenths of
the whole *Radicle*; and in each *Lobe*, is so far over-proportionate, as
to make at least nine Tenths of the whole *Lobe*.

21. §. By what hath been said, that the *Parenchyma* or *Pulp* is not
the only constituting *Part*, besides the *Cuticle*, is imply’d: there being
another *Body*, of an essentially different substance, embosom’d herein:
which may be found not only in the *Radicle* and *Plume*, but also
in the *Lobes* themselves, and so in the whole *Bean*.

22. §. This *Inner Body* appears very plain and conspicuous in
cutting the *Radicle* athwart, and so proceeding by degrees towards
the *Plume*, through both which it runneth in a large and strait *Trunk*. *Tab. 1. f. 10, 11, & 12.*
In the *Lobes*, being it is there in so very small proportion, ’tis difficultly
seen, especially towards their *Verges*. Yet if with a sharp Knife
you smoothly cut the *Lobes* of the *Bean* athwart, divers small *Specks*, *Tab. 1. f. 13.*
of a different colour from that of the *Parenchyma*, standing therein all
along in a Line, may be observ’d; which *Specks* are the Terminations
of the *Branches* of this *Inner Body*.

23. §. For this *Inner body*, as it is existent in every *Organical Part*
of the *Bean*; so is it, with respect to each *Part*, most regularly distributed.
In a good part of the *Radicle* ’tis one entire *Trunk*; towards
the *Basis* thereof, ’tis divided into three main *Branches*; *Tab. 1. f. 14.*  the middlemost
runneth directly into the *Plume*; the other two on either side of
it, after a little space, pass into the *Lobes*; where the said *Branches*
dividing themselves into other smaller; and those into more, and smaller
again, are terminated towards the Verges of each *Lobe*; in which
manner the said *Inner Body* being distributed it becomes in each *Lobe* a
true and perfect *Root*.

24. §. Of this *Seminal Root*, as now we’ll call it, from the Description
here given, it is further observable; That the two main *Branches*
hereof; in which the several *Ramifications* in each *Lobe* are all united,
are not committed into the *Seminal Trunk* of the *Plume*, nor yet
stand at right angles with *That* and the *Radicle*, and so with equal respect
towards them both: but being produced through part of the *Parenchyma*
of the *Radicle*, are at last united therein to the main *Trunk*,
and make acute Angles therewith: as may be seen in the same. *f. 14.* *Tab. 1. f. 14.*

25. §. This *Seminal Root* being so tender, cannot be perfectly excarnated,
(as may the *Vessels* in the *Parts* of an *Animal*) by the most
accurate Hand. Yet by dissection begun and continu’d, as is above
declared, its whole frame and distribution may be easily observ’d. Again,
if you take the *Lobe* of a *Bean*, and lengthwise pare off its *Parenchyma*
by degrees, and in extreme thin slices, many *Branches* of the *Seminal
Root*, (which by the other way of Dissection were only noted by so
many *Specks*) both as they are fewer about the Basis of the *Bean*, and
more numerous towards its Verges, in some good distinction and entireness
will appear. For this you must have new *Beans*: or else soaked in
Water, or buryed for some time.

26. §. As the *Inner Body* is branched out in the *Lobes*, so is it in
the *Plume*: For if you cut the *Plume* athwart, and from the *Basis* proceed
along the Body thereof, you’ll therein find, first, one large *Trunk*

or *Branch*, and after four or five very small *Specks* round about it,
which are the terminations of so many lesser *Branches* therewith distributed
to the several parts of the *Plume*. *Tab. 1. f. 11* c.  The distribution of the
*Inner Body*, as it is continuous throughout all the *Organical Parts* of
the *Bean*, is represented, *Tab. 1. f. 14.*

27. §. This *Inner Body* is, by dissection, best observable in the
*Bean* and great *Lupine*. In other larger *Pulse* it shews likewise some
obscure Marks of it self. But in no other *Seeds*, which I have observed,
though of the greatest size: as of *Apples*, *Plums*, *Nuts*, &c. is there any
clear appearance hereof, upon dissection, saving in the *Radicle* and
*Plume*; the reason of which is partly from its being, in most *Seeds*,
so extraordinary little; partly from its Colour, which in most *Seeds*,
is the same with that of the *Parenchyma* it self, and so not distinguishable
from it.

28. §. Yet in a *Gourd-Seed*, the whole *Seminal Root*, not only its
*Main Branches*, *Tab. 1. f. 15.* c.  but also the Sub-divisions and *Inosculations* of the lesser
ones, are without any dissection, upon the separation of the *Lobes*, on
their contiguous Flats immediately apparent.

And as to the existence of this *Seminal Root*, what Dissection cannot
attain, yet an ocular inspection in hundreds of other *Seeds*, even
the smallest, will demonstrate; as in this *Chapter* shall be seen how.

29. §. In the mean time, let us only take notice; That when we
say, every *Plant* hath its *Root*, we reckon short. For every *Plant* hath
really two, though not contemporary, yet successive *Roots*; its *Original*
or *Seminal-Root* within the *Lobes* or *Main Body* of its *Seed*; and
its *Plant-Root*, which the *Radicle* becometh in its growth: the *Parenchyma*
of the *Seed*, being in some resemblance, that to the *Seminal
Root* at first, which the Mould is to the *Plant-Root* afterwards; and
the *Seminal Root* being that to the *Plant-Root*, which the *Plant-Root*
is to the *Trunk*. For our better understanding whereof, having taken
a view of the several *Parts* of a *Bean*, as far as Dissection conducts;
we will next briefly enquire into the Use of the said *Parts*, and in
what manner they are the Fountain of *Vegetation*, and concurrent to the
being of the future *Plant*.

An Account of the *Vegetation* of the *Seed*.
30. §. THE GENERAL Cause of the growth of a *Bean*, or other
*Seed*, is *Fermentation*. That is, the *Bean* lying in the Mould, and a
moderate access of some moisture, partly dissimilar, and partly congenerous,
being made, a gentle *Fermentation* thence ariseth. By which,
the *Bean* swelling, and the *Sap* still encreasing, and the *Bean* continuing
still to swell, the work thus proceeds: as is the usual way of explicating.
But that there is simply a *Fermentation*, and so a sufficient
supply of *Sap* is not enough: but that this *Fermentation*, and the *Sap*
wherein ’tis made, should be under a various Government, by divers
*Parts* thereto subservient, is also requisite; and as the various preparation
of the *Aliment* in an *Animal*, equally necessary: the particular
process of the Work according whereto, we find none undertaking to
declare.

31. §. Let us look upon a *Bean* then, as a piece of Work so fram’d
and set together, as to declare a Design for the production of a *Plant*;
which, upon its lying in some convenient Soil, is thus effected. First
of all, the *Bean* being enfoulded round in its *Coats*, the *Sap* wherewith
it is fed, must of necessity pass through these: By which means, it is

not only in a proportionate quantity, and by degrees; but also in a
purer body; and possibly not without some *Vegetable Tincture*, transmitted
to the *Bean*. Whereas, were the *Bean* naked, the *Sap* must
needs be, as over-copious, so but crude and immature, as not being *filtred*
through so fine a *Cotton* as the *Coats* be. And as they have the use
of a *Filtre* to the transient *Sap*; so of a *Vessel* to that which is still
deposited within them; being alike accommodated to the securer *Fermentation*
hereof, as Bottles or Barrels are to Beer, or any other *Fermentative
Liquor*.

32. §. And as the *Fermentation* is promoted by some *Aperture* in
the Vessel; so have we the *Foramen* in the upper *Coat* also contrived.
That if there should be need of some more *Aiery* Particles to excite
the *Fermentation*; through *this*, they may obtain their Entry. Or,
on the contrary, should there be any such *Particles* or *Steams*, as might
damp the genuine proceeding thereof, through this again, they may
have easie issue. Or if, by being over copious, they should become too
high a *Ferment*; and so precipitate those soft and slow degrees, as are
necessary to a due *Vegetation*. The said *Aperture* being that, as a common
Pasport, here to the *Sap*, which what we call the *Bung-hole* of
the Barrel, is to the new tunn’d Liquor.

33. §. And the *Radicle* being designed to shoot forth first, as presently
shall be shew’d how; therefore is it distinctly surrounded with
the Inner and more succulent *Coat*. That being thereby suppled on
every side, its eruption may be the better promoted.

34. §. The *Sap* being passed through the *Coats*, it next enters the
Body of the *Bean*; yet not indiscriminately neither; but, being filtred
through the *Outer Coat*, and fermented in the Body of the *Inner*, is by
mediation of the *Cuticle*, again more finely filtr’d, and so entereth the
*Parenchyma* it self under a fourth Government.

35. §. Through which *Part* the *Sap* passing towards the *Seminal
Root*, as through that which is of a more spatious content; besides the
benefit it hath of a farther *percolation*, it will also find room enough
for a more free and active fermenting and *maturation* herein. And being
moreover, part of the true Body of the *Bean*, and so with its proper
*Seminalities* or *Tinctures* copiously repleat; the *Sap* will not only
find *room*, but also *matter* enough, by whose Energy its *Fermentation*
will still be more advanced.

36. §. And the *Sap* being duly prepared here, it next passeth into
all the *Branches* of the *Seminal Root*, and so under a fifth Government.
Wherein how delicate ’tis now become, we may conceive by the proportion
betwixt the *Parenchyma* and this *Seminal Root*; so much only
of the best digested *Sap* being discharged from the whole Stock in that,
as this will receive. And this, moreover, as the *Parenchyma*, with its
proper *Seminalities* being endowed; the *Sap* for the supply of the *Radicle*,
and of the young *Root* from thence, is duly prepared therein, and
with its highest *Tincture* and *Impregnation* at last enriched.

37. §. The *Sap* being thus prepared in the *Lobes* of the *Bean*, ’tis
thence discharg’d; and either into the *Plume*, or the *Radicle*, must forthwith
issue. And since the *Plume* is a dependent on the *Radicle*; the
*Sap* therefore ought first to be dispenced to this: which accordingly,
is ever found to shoot forth before the *Plume*: and sometimes an inch
or two in length. Now because the primitive course of the *Sap* into

the *Radicle*, is thus requisite; therefore, by the frame of the *Parts* of
the *Bean* is it also made necessary. The two main *Branches* of the *Seminal
Root*, being produced, as is before observed, not into the *Plume*,
but the *Radicle*. Now the *Sap* being brought as far as the *Seminal
Root*, in either *Lobe*; and according to the conduct thereof continuing
still to move: it must needs immediately issue into the same *Part*,
*Tab. 1. f. 14.*  whereinto the main *Branches* themselves do; that is, into the *Radicle*.
By which *Sap*, thus bringing the several *Tinctures* of the *Parts* aforesaid
with it, being now fed; it is no longer a meer *Radicle*, but is
made also *Seminal*, and so becomes a perfect *Root*.

38. §. The *Plume*, all this while, lyes close and still. For the sake
of which, chiefly it is, that the *Bean* and other *Seeds* are divided into
*Lobes*, *viz.* That it might be warmly and safely lodged up between
them, and so secur’d from the Injuries so tender a *Part* would sustain
from the Mould; whereto, had the *Main Body* been entire, it must,
upon the cleaving of the *Coats*, have lay’n contiguous.

39. §. But the *Radicle* being thus impregnated and shot into a
*Root*; ’tis now time for the *Plume* to rouze out of its Cloysters, and
germinate too: In order whereto, ’tis now fed from the *Root*, with
laudable and sufficient *Aliment*. For as the Supplies and Motion of
*Sap* were first made from the *Lobes*, towards the *Root*: so the *Root*
being well shot into the Mould, and now receiving a new and more
copious *Sap* from thence; the motion hereof must needs be stronger,
and by degrees proceed in a contrary course, *sc.* from the *Root* toward
the *Plume*: and, by the continuation of the *Seminal Root*, is directly
conducted thereinto; by which being fed, it gradually enlarges
and displays it self.

40. §. The course of the *Sap* thus turned, it issues, I say, in a
direct Line from the *Root* into the *Plume*: but collaterally, into the
*Lobes* also; *sc.* by those two aforesaid *Branches* which are obliquely
transmitted from the *Radicle* into either *Lobe*. By which *Branches* the
said *Sap* being disbursed back into all the *Seminal Root*, and from
thence, likewise into the *Parenchyma* of the *Lobes*, they are both thus
fed, and for some time augmenting themselves, really grow: as in *Lupines*
is evident.

41. §. Yet is not this common to all *Seeds*. Some rot underground;
as *Corn*; being of a laxer and less Oleous Substance, differing
herein from most other *Seeds*; and being not divided into *Lobes*, but
one entire thick Body. And some, although they continue firm, and
are divided into *Lobes*, yet rise not; as the great *Garden Bean*. In
which, therefore, it is observable, That the two Main *Branches* of the
*Lobes*, in comparison with that which runs into the *Plume*, are but
mean; *Tab. 1. f. 14.*  and so insufficient to the feeding and vegetation of the *Lobes*;
the *Plume*, on the contrary, growing so lusty, as to mount up without
them.

42. §. Excepting a few of these Two Kinds, all other *Seeds* whatsoever,
(which I have observed) besides that they continue firm;
upon the *Vegetation* of the *Plume*, do mount also upwards, and advance
above the Ground together with it; as all *Seeds* which spring up with
one or more *Dissimilar Leaves*: These *Dissimilar Leaves*, for the most
part *Two*, which first spring up, and are of a different shape from those
that follow, being the very *Lobes* of the *Seed*, divided, expanded, and thus
advanced.

43. §. The Impediments of our apprehension hereof are the Colour,
Size and Shape of the *Dissimilar Leaves*. Notwithstanding, that
they are nothing else but the *Main Body* of the *Seed*, how I came
first to conceive, and afterwards to know it, was thus. First, I observed
in general, that the *Dissimilar Leaves*, were never jagg’d, but
even edg’d: And seeing the even verges of the *Lobes* of the *Seed* hereto
respondent, I was apt to think, that those which were so like, might
prove the same. Next descending to particular *Seeds*, I observed, first,
of the *Lupine*; that, as to its Colour, advancing above the Ground,
(as it useth to do) it was always changed into a perfect Green. And
why might not the same by parity of Reason be inferred of other *Seeds*?
That, as to its size, it grew but little bigger than when first set. Whence,
as I discern’d (the Augmentation being but little) we here had only
the two *Lobes*: *Tab. 2. f. 1.*  So, (as some augmentation there was) I inferr’d the
like might be, and that, in farther degrees, in other *Seeds*.

44. §. Next of the *Cucumber-Seed*, That, as to its Colour, often
appearing above ground, in its primitive white, from white it turns to
yellow, and from yellow to green; the proper colour of a *Leaf*. That,
as to its size, though at its first arise, the *Lobes* were little bigger than
upon setting; yet afterwards, as they chang’d their Colour, *Tab. 2. f. 2.*  so their dimensions
also, growing to a three-four-five-fold amplitude above their
primitive size. But whereas the *Lobes* of the *Seed*, are in proportion,
narrow, short and thick: how then come the *Dissimilar Leaves*, to be
so exceeding broad, or long, and thin? The Question answers it self:
For the *Dissimilar Leaves*, for that very reason are so thin, because so
very broad or long; as we see many things, how much they are extended
in length or breadth, so much they lose in depth, or grow
more thin; which is that which here befalls the now effoliated *Lobes*.
For being once dis-imprisoned from their *Coats*, and the course of the *Sap*
into them, now more and more encreased; they must needs very considerably
amplifie themselves: and from the manner wherein the *Seminal
Root* is branched in them, that amplification cannot be in thickness,
but in length or breadth. In both which, in some *Dissimilar
Leaves*, ’tis very remarkable; *Tab. 2. f. 3.*  especially in length, as in those of *Lettice*,
*Thorn-Apple*, and others; whose *Seeds*, although very small, yet
the *Lobes* of those *Seeds* growing up into *Dissimilar Leaves*, are extended
an Inch, and sometimes more, in length. Though he that shall attempt to
get a clear sight of the *Lobes* of *Thorn-Apple*, and some others, by *Dissection*,
will find it no easie Task; yet is that which may be obtained; and in
the Last *Book* shall be shew’d. From all which, and the observation
of other *Seeds*, I at last found, that the *Dissimilar Leaves* of
a young *Plant*, are nothing else but the *Lobes* or *Main Body* of its
*Seed*. So that, as the *Lobes* did at first feed and impregnate the *Radicle*
into a *perfect Root*; so the *Root*, being perfected, doth again feed,
and by degrees amplifie each *Lobe* into a perfect *Leaf*.

45. §. The Original of the *Dissimilar Leaves* thus known, we understand,
why some *Plants* have none; because the *Seed* either riseth
not, as *Garden-Beans*, *Corn*, &c. Or upon rising, the *Lobes* are little
alter’d, as *Lupines*, *Pease*, &c. Why, though the proper *Leaves* are
often indented round; the *Dissimilar* like the *Lobes* are even-edg’d.
Why, though the proper *Leaves* are often hairy, yet these are ever
smooth. Why some have more *Dissimilar Leaves* than two, as *Cresses*,

which have six, as the Ingenious Mr. *Sharrock* also observes. Hist. of the *Prop.* of *Vege.*  The reason
whereof is, because the *Main Body* is not divided into Two, but Six, distinct
*Lobes*, as I have often counted. Why *Radishes* seem at first to
have four, which yet after appear plainly two: because the *Lobes* of the
*Seed*, have both a little Indenture, and are both plaited, one over the
other. To which, other Instances might be added.

46. The use of the *Dissimilar Leaves* is, first, for the protection
of the *Plume*; which being but young, and so but soft and tender, is
provided with these, as a double Guard, one on either side of it. For
this reason it is, that the *Plume*, in *Corn*, is trussed up within a membranous
*Sheath*: and that of a *Bean*, cooped up betwixt a pair of *Surfoyls*:
*Tab. 3.*  But where the *Lobes* rise, there the *Plume* hath neither of them,
being both needless.

47. §. Again, since the *Plume*, being yet tender, may be injur’d
not only by the *Aer*, but also for want of *Sap*, the supplies from
the *Root* being yet but slow and sparing; that the said *Plume* therefore,
by the *Dissimilar Leaves*, may have the advantage likewise of
some refreshment from Dew or Rain. For these having their *Basis*
a little beneath that of the *Plume*, and expanding themselves on all
sides of it, they often stand after Rain, like a Vessel of Water, continually
soaking and suppling it, lest its new access into the *Ayr*, should
shrivel it.

48. §. Moreover, that since the *Dissimilar Leaves* by their *Basis*
intercept the *Root* and *Plume*, the greater and grosser part of the
*Sap*, may be, by the way, deposited into those; and so the purest proceed
into the yet but young and delicate *Plume*, as its fittest *Aliment*.

49. §. Lastly, we have here a demonstration of the being of
the *Seminal Root*: which, since through the colour or smalness of
the *Seed*, it could not by Dissection be observ’d, except in some
few; Nature hath here provided us a way of viewing it in the now
effoliated *Lobes*, not of one or two *Seeds*, but of hundreds; the *Seminal
Root* visibly branching it self towards the Cone or Verges of the
said *Lobes*, or now *Dissimilar Leaves*.
