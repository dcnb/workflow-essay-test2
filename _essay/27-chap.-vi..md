### Of the Motions of Trunks.

HE
*Motions* also of *Trunks* are various. Principally
*Four*; *sc.* *Ascending*, *Descending*, *Horizontal*,
and *Spiral*. The cause of the *Ascent* of a *Plant*, is a
certain *Magnetick Correspendence* betwixt the *Aer* and
the *Aer-Vessels* of a *Plant*; the *Motion* and *Tendency*
whereof, the whole *Plant* follows. This I have asserted,
and I think, clearly demonstrated in my
*First* and *Second* **Books** of the *Anatomy* of *Plants*. I will here add
this plain *Experiment*.

2. §. Take a Box of *Moulds*, with a hole bored in the bottom,
wide enough to admit the *Stalk* of a *Plant*, and set it upon stilts half
a yard or more above ground. Then lodg in the *Mould* some *Plant*,
for Example a *Bean*, in such sort, that the *Root* of the *Bean* standing
in the *Moulds* may poynt upwards, the *Stalk* towards the ground.
As the *Plant* grows, it will follow, that at length the *Stalk* will rise
upward, and the *Root*, on the contrary, arch it self downward. Which
evidently shews, That it is not sufficient, that the *Root* hath *Earth* to
shoot into, or that its *Motion* is only an *Appetite* of being therein
lodged, which way soever that be: but that its nature is, though
within the *Earth* already, yet to change its *Position*, and to *move Downwards*.
And so likewise of the *Trunk*, that it rises, when a *Seed* sprouts,
out of the Ground, not meerly because it hath an *Appetite* of being
in the open *Aer*; for in this Experiment it is so already; yet now makes
a new *Motion* upwards.

3. §. BUT although the *Natural Motion* of the *Trunk* be to
*Ascend*; yet is it forced oftentimes to *Descend*. For the *Trunk-Roots*
growing out of some *Plants* near the ground, and shrinking thereinto,
like so many *Ropes*, do pluck the *Trunk* annually lower and lower
into the ground together with them; as may be seen in *Scrophularia*,
*Jacobæa*, and many other *Plants*.

4. §. IF these *Trunk-Roots* break out only about the *bottom* of the
*Trunk*, as in the aforesaid *Plants*, then the *Trunk* gradually *Descends*
into the *Earth*, and is turned into a *Root*. But if it be very *slender*, and
the *Trunk-Roots* break forth *all along* it, then it *Creeps* horizontally;
the said *Roots* tethering it, as it trails along, to the ground; as *Strawberry*,
*Cinquefoyl*, *Mint*, *Scordium*, &c.

5. §. AS to their *Spiral Motion*, it is to be noted; That the *Wood*
of all *Convolvulus* or *Winders*, stands more close and round together in
or near the Center, thereby making a round, and slender *Trunk*. To
the end, it may be more tractable, to the power of the external *Motor*,
what ever that be: and also more secure from breaking by its winding
*Motion*.

6. §. Wherefore, *Convolvulus* do not wind by any peculiar Nature
or *Genius*, which other *Trunks* have not; but because their *Parts*
are disposed so, as to render them more sequaceous to the external
*Motor*. Even as the *Claspers* of a *Vine*, having the like *Structure*, have
also a *Motion* of *Convolution*: whereas the *Branches* themselves upon a
contrary account, move in a *straight Line*.

7. §. The *Convolution* of *Plants*, hath been observed only in those that
Climb. But it seems probable, that many others do also *wind*; in
which, the main *Stalk*, is as the *Axis* to the *Branches* round about.
 *B. 2. P. 1. Ch. 1.* Of
which number, I conceive, are all those whose *Roots* are twisted; a
*Motion* we observed in speaking of the *Root*. Whether it be so, or
not the Experiment may easily be made by tying a *Thred* upon any of
the *Branches*; setting down the respect it then hath to any Quarter in
the *Heavens*: for, if it shall appear in two or three Months, to have
changed its Situation towards some other Quarter; it is a certain proof
hereof. And that hereby the *Roots* of many *Plants* become twisted;
the *Motion* beginning in the *Stalk*, and ending at the bottom of the
*Root*, which stands always fixed in the same place.

8. §. The *Convolution* of *Trunks*, is made not *one*, but *divers* ways;
some moving by *South* from *East* to *West*; and others from *West* to *East*.
Wherefore it seemeth, that as the *Efficient Cause* of *Convolution*, is not
within the *Plant*, but external: so also, that it is not *One*, but that there
are *Two Great Efficients* of this *Motion*; *sc.* the *Sun* and the *Moon*.
Some winding together with the *Sun*, in its *Diurnal Motion*, (or, if the
Earth moves, then, Inclining to the *Sun*) by *South* from *East* to
*West*. And others winding with the *Moon*, in its *Monthly Motion*, from
*West* to *East*.

9. §. This possibly, may also be one *sensible* way of distinguishing
betwixt *Solar*, and *Lunar Plants*. Thus far, in general, of the *Motions*
of *Trunks*.
