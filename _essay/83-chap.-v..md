### CHAP. V.

### Of the Judgment which may be made of the VIRTUES
    of Plants, from their Tasts.

![A](images/i_drop_a_143.jpg)
S
 by duly observing the *Tasts* of *Plants*, we may be
directed to understand their *Causes*. So also the
*Use* and *Virtues* of those *Plants* or *Parts* of *Plants*
in which they reside. For the proof whereof, an
*Instance* might be fetched from every particular
difference of *Tast* before set down. But it may be
enough, to give these which follow.

2. §. And first, we may make no ill guess *ex
Analogia*, or where we find the same *Tast*, that there the same *Virtue*
in some kind, and in some degree, may reside. So *Jalap*, *Mercury*,
and *Daisy*, have all of them that exasperating *Tast* in the *Throat* before
described; and they are all three more or less *Cathartick*. Wherefore,
we may believe, that other *Plants* which make the like *Impression*
on the *Throat*, and there are many others which do, that
they are in some degree alike *Cathartick*. Those *Plants* which
are reckoned amongst the chiefest *Cephalicks*, cause rather a durable,
than a vehement *Heat* upon the *Tongue*, as *Pyrethrum*, *Euphorbium*,
*Black-Hellebore*, &c. It seemeth therefore reasonable to
rank with these, any other *Plant*, though not used, which produceth
the like durable *Heat*. The young *Roots* of *Yarrow*, or *Millefolium*,

have the same *Taste*, as the *Root* of *Contrayerva*: and may therefore be
used for the same purpose, with a probability of the like success; if
not a better, because they may be gotten fresher. But by drying the
*Root*, the *Tast* and *Virtue*, which lie in its exhalible parts, are much
lost. The *Seeds* of the lesser *Cardamom*, and of *Zedoary Root*, if found,
have both a smatch of the *Tast* of *Camphire*. They may therefore all,
so far, reach the same Case.

3. §. Again, as we may make no ill conjecture from the sameness of
*Taste* in *Plants* of several *Tribes*; so from the diversity of *Taste*, in those
of the same. So the *Flowers* of all the *Docks* are evidently *Astringent*,
and not *Sower*; except those of the *Rha-pontick*, which are extream
sower, even in the 5ᵗʰ degree. Which is no mean *Signature* of some
more than ordinary *Virtue* in it, besides what it hath in common with
the rest of the *Tribe*. The *Flowers* of *Pancy* have a kind of fulsome
*Tast*, plainly different from that of *Violets*: and in some *Hypochondriacal
Cases* may be more useful.

4. §. It likewise importeth much, to observe the difference of *Taste*
in the several *Parts* of the same *Plant*. So the *Barque* of *Sassafras* is three
times as strong, as the *Wood*: and the like may be observed in any
other commonly known *Tree*. If therefore we could obtein the *Barques*
of *Santalum*, *Lignum Rhodium*, *Lignum Aloes*, &c. they would doubtless,
most of them, be of much greater use. And as the *Taste* is sometimes
stronger; so, much more grateful, in one *Part* than in another:
as in the *Flowers* or *Yellow Attire* in the *Heads* of *Carduus Benedictus*;
which being infused in *Spirit* of *Wine*, or other convenient *Liquor*,
make a pleasant *Cordial*. Nature having laped up the *Virtue* in the
*Leavs*, as in a brown *Paper*; but in the *Flowers*, as in *Leaf-Gold*.

5. §. As also, how far the *Taste* of any *Plant* may alter, either in
preserving, or preparing it. So the *Root* of *Arum*, when taken fresh
out of the ground, is notably *Pungent*: but being throughly dryed,
and especially kept for some time, hath no more *Taste*, and therefore
in all likelyhood, no more *Virtue*, than a *Lump* of *Starch*. The like
we are to judge of all other *Plants*, whose *Virtue* lieth in their exhalible
*Parts*. The *Stillatitious Oyls* of many *Plants*, are stronger than the
*Leavs* or other *Parts* from whence they are drawn: but some there
are, which are weaker; as is that of *Euphorbium*, in which the *Heat* is
neither pertinaceous, as in the *Gum* it self, nor so great.

6. §. We may make, moreover, a judgment from the *Nature* of
the *Tast*. So those *Roots* which are *Bitter*, and not *Hot*, as of *Cichory*,
and the rest of the *Intybous* kind, may be accounted *Nitro-Sulphureous*;
and so, to be *Abstersive* without any *Heating Quality*. The *Marum
Austriacum*, which is extream *Pungent*, as well as *Aromatick*, may be
looked upon as the best *Cephalick* of that *Tribe*. Because we find,
that *Jalap* hath a special property of imitating the *Glandulous Parts*
of the *Mouth*, and *Throat*; we may gather, That it is a better
*Purge* to all the other *Glandulous Parts*, than most other *Catharticks*.
Which is also one reason of its operation, for the most part, with at
least a tendency to vomit; the *Stomach* it self being *Glandulous* as well
as the *Throat*, and thereby answerably affected with it. A strong *Infusion*
of *white Sarzaparilla* in *Water*, botled up, and kept in a *Cellar* for
the space of two months, becomes extream sower; far beyond any
thing observed in the *Tasts* of the *Juyces* and *Infusions* of divers other

*Plants* kept as long and in the same manner. Which shews, how well
Nature hath adapted a *Plant* of so mild a *Taste*, either by similitude of
parts, for the carrying off of any *preternatural Acid*; or by contrariety,
for the curbing of an exorbitant *Salt*. The *Barque* of the *Root* of
common *Wormwood*, which impresseth a pertinaceous and diffusive *Taste*,
which descendeth from the *Tongue* into the *Gulet*, as is before described;
may be justly ranked with the most excellent *Stomachicks*; and
upon tryal, I find it one of the best: besides, that it is neither unpleasant,
nor affecteth the *Head*, as the *Leavs*. Yet the *Gardener*, and
every Body throws it away, as good for nothing.

7. §. I shall conclude with one note, which is this; That the *Specifick
Virtue* of *Medicines*, which some *Physicians* positively deny, and
most dispute; from some of the forementioned *Differences* of *Taste*, as
well as for other reasons, may seem, at least, to be probable. For
why should not a *Medicine* make an *Impression* upon one *Part*, and not
upon another, within the *Body*, as well as we find it doth within the
*Mouth*? especially, since the *Parts* of the *Mouth*, are of a less different
*Nature*, than some of the *Viscera*.

### An Appendix.

### Of the ODOURS of Plants.

![T](images/i_drop_t_119.jpg)
HE
 *Senses* of *Tasting* and *Smelling* being so nearly
ally’d; many things already explained concerning
the *Diversities* and *Causes* of *Tasts* in *Plants*, may
easily be transferr’d to those of their *Odours*. I
shall now therefore only remarque some particulars,
not commonly taken notice of hitherto, and leave
them as a *Specimen* to be Improved by other Hands.

2. §. The *Root* of *Rape-Crowfoot* being cut, and held to the *Nose*,
when it is newly taken out of the *Ground*, smelleth almost like
*Spirit* of *Sal Armoniac*, or fresh *Scurvygrass Juyce*. And hath the property
of making the *Eyes* to water, as *Onions* do. *Horse-Radish Root*
is not so *Pungent* to the *Nose*, but gets pretty much into the *Eyes*. But
that of *Dragon*, doth neither affect the *Eyes*, nor the *Nose*.

3. §. The *Succulent Roots* of *Dogstones*, and most of that *Tribe*,
have a rank *Smell*. And that of *Crown Imperial*, being rub’d a little,
smells as like a *Fox*, as one *Fox* smelleth like another.

4. §. The *Root* of *Patience* digested with *Water*, in a warm *Room*,
for the space of three weeks, smels like *Spirit* of *Harts Horn*, or other
*Urinous Spirit*. Of *Red Dock*, almost like *Aqua fortis* or *Spirit* of *Nitre*.
That of *Dragon* bottled up with *Water*, and set in a *Cellar*, about a
Month, stinks like the *pus* of the most *Fetid Ulcer*. At the end of five
Months, more abominably, than either to be endured or expressed.

5. §. The *Leavs* of *Mountain Calamint*, smell like *Peny Royal*.
Those of *Ulmaria*, like *Walnut Pills*. Of *Yellow Lamium*, like a *Balsame*.
Of *Sena*, a good quantity being held to the *Nose*, of a rank

*Smell* betwixt that of *Sweat* and *Urine*. Of *Coriander*, when green and
young, stink so basely, that they can hardly be endur’d. Sometimes
the *Leavs* have a stronger *Smell*, than the *Flower*, as in *Borage*, and
sometimes the *Stalk*, a stronger than the *Leavs*, as in *Ulmaria*.

6. §. *Rue Leavs* corked up in a bottle and set in a *Cellar* for about
ten weeks, smell like *Spirit* of *Harts Horn*, or of *Urine*. The green
*Leaves* of *Roses* infused in water, have a mild, but pleasant *Smell*. Neither
is that of *Savine* unpleasant, upon the like *Infusion*.

7. §. *Scurvygrass Juyce* kept about ¾ of a year in bottles, with the
green *Sedement*, in a warm *Room*, stinks like Humane *Excrements*. And
*Scurvygrass Wine*, made only of the *Juyce*, smells like some *Issues*.

8. §. The *Flowers* of *Yarrow*, smell not much unlike to those of
*Southernwood*. And the *Flowers* of *Crowfoot* almost like those of *Scurvygrass*.
Some *Flowers* are of a weaker *Smell* in the *Bud*, as those of
*Mallow*. But many have a stronger, than when they are blown open;
as those of *Lavender*, *Rosemary*, &c.

9. §. The *Buds* of *Vervaine Mallow*, while they are young, and
the *Flowers* unseen, have a very pleasant *Smell*, like that of *Geranium
Moschatum*: but when afterwards they are opened they have an unpleasant
*Smell*. Common *Mallow Flowers* dryed and bottled up for some
time, acquire, though not a strong, yet very noysom *Smell*.

10. §. The *Purple Pouch* of *Dragon* which covers the *Seed*, being
broken, smells just like a *Lobster*. But permitted to lie in a warm *Room*
for some days, smells exactly like *Carrion*; and scents the *Room* with
the same *Smell*.

11. §. Some *Seeds* as those of *Cumine*, *Daucus*, being powdered
and laped up only in *Papers*, do notwithstanding retein their *Smell*.
But many others, as of *Sweet Fenil*, in a short time, lose it. Some
*Seeds*, when they first begin to sprout, become *Odorous*, which were
not so before; as the *Garden Bean*.
