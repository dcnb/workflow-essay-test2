### CHAP. III.

### Wherein, from the Experiments in the foregoing Chapter,
is shewed, the Cause of the Motion of the Mercury in
the BAROMETER.

OR
 the doing of this, it will first be acknowledg’d,
That not only several sorts of *Sulphur*, but also of
*Volatile Salts*, are continually sublimed from most
*Bodies* into the *Aer*. So *Lightning*, from the celerity
of the ascension, appears to be made of a *Meteor*,
which is *Nitro-Sulphureous*. *Snow* dependeth upon
a *Mixture* of *Nitrous*, and other *Salts*; as is evident,
from the regularly and differently *Figur’d Parts*, which compose
the whole Body of a *Snowy Cloud*, before it clusters into *Flakes*. And
one reason, why *Rain* is the best *Water* for any *Soyl*, is because it is impregnated
with divers *Volatile* and *Fruitful Salts*. And so from other
*Meteors*.

2. §. And next, that these *Salts*, are not always in the same *Quantity*,
*Proportion*, and *State*, in the *Aer*: but that sometimes they are
more copious; at others, less: sometimes, one more copious, than an
other: sometimes, more plentifully dissolved; at others, more sparingly:
and that, either as they are more or less pure and dissoluble; or
according to the quantity of the *Vaporous Parts* in the *Aer*, in which
they are incorporated or dissolved.

3. §. Thus much being granted, from the *Experiments* in the foregoing
*Chapter* compared together, we may resolve our selves about
some *Phænomena* in the *Barometre*. Which seems to vary, not so much
with the meer *Weight* of the *Aer*, which hitherto hath been supposed:
as by the different pressure it makes, in being *crowded* more at
one time, than at another. That is, according as certain *Nitrous*, or
other *Saline Bodies*, take up less *Space* in the *Aer*, when dissolved in the
*Watery Parts* therein, than while they are undissolved.

4. §. And therefore it is especially to be observed, That as the
*Mercury* commonly riseth in the *Cylinder* for some days, but always
for some time, before the change of the *Weather*, whether for *Snow* or
*Rain*: So, that then it presently falleth again, even before the *Snow*
or *Rain* falls. Whereas, if the *Weight* of the *Aer*, were the only, or
the chief *Cause* of the ascent of the *Mercury*; than as it riseth all the
while the *Weather* is gathering, so it would keep its standing or heighth,
until the *Weather* breaks and falleth down: which yet it never doth,
but always falls before it; sometimes no less than a whole day. The
*Cause* whereof is, in that all the while the *Mercury* riseth in the *Cylinder*,
the *Aer* is *crowded* with more and more *Saline Parts*, which by

the *Winds*, or otherwise, are carryed into it; and so causeth it to
press upon the *Mercury* in the *Box*: but after that in some time the
*Salts* are dissolved or incorporated in the *Aqueous Parts* of the *Aer*, as
in *Rain* or *Snow*; so soon as that is done, there is some *Space* gaind; and
so, before any *Weather* falleth, the *Aer* is less crowded, and presseth
less upon the *Mercury* in the *Box*, which gives way to its descent in
the *Cylinder*.

5. §. From hence also it is, that the *Mercury* riseth higher with
*Cold Winds*, than it doth with those which are *Warme*. Both because
that in *cold Winds* there is the greatest quantity of *Nitre*: and that the
*coldest Winds*, are usually the dryest. So that the *Nitre* wanting
*Moysture* fully to dissolve it; it takes up so much the greater space, and
so causeth a greater pressure in the *Aer*, as hath been said.

6. §. *Lastly*, For the same reason it comes to pass, that the *Mercury*
first riseth higher, and then falleth lower before *Snow*, than it doth
before *Rain*. Because that for the production of *Snow*, the *Aer* is
crowded with a greater quantity of *Nitre*, or some other like *Salts*;
which before they are dissolved, take up so much the more space;
and afterwards so much the less, even before the *Snow* falls: as hath
been proved.
