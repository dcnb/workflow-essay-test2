### CHAP. V.

### Of the BUDS of Seeds. And of the PARTS, of
    which these, the Radicle, and Lobes are compounded.

ROM
between the two *Lobes*, rises up the *Stalk* of
the *Plant*. The original whereof, either to the
naked *Eye*, or by a good *Glass*, is always visible in
the *Seed*.

2. §. In many *Plants*, *Nature* sees fit only to lay
the foundation hereof in a small round *Node*; where
upon the *Leavs*, in the *Vegetation* of the *Seed*, are
superstructed: as in *Viola Lunaria*, and others.

3. §. But in the greater number of *Seeds*, is formed a true *Bud*,
consisting of perfect *Leavs*; different from those, which grow upon
the *Stalk*, only in *Bigness*; and so far in *Shape*, as the same *Parts* of an
Animal *Fœtus*, in its several ages in the *Womb*. In many *Seeds*, as well

small as great, and as well of *Herbs* as *Trees*, it is very apparent. But
oftentimes lyeth so deep between the *Lobes* as to be almost undiscernable,
as in *Maple*.

4. §. The *Leaves* of the *Bud*, in different *Plants*, are of a different
*Number*; in some, Two; in others, Four, Six, and sometimes more.
In the *Bay-Berry*, they are only two; very small, but thick or fat,
and finely veined. In the *Seed* of *Carduus Benedictus*, *Tab. 78.* they are also
Two; almost invisible; broad at the *Bottom*, poynted at the *Top*,
thick or fat, yet plated inward, and postured a little distant one from
the other; for the two next to rise up between them. The like may
be seen in *Carthamum*; and so, I suppose, in all the *Carduus Kind*.

5. §. In some *Herbs*, although the *Bud* consisteth but of two perfect
*Leaves*, yet they are very conspicuous. *Tab. 78.* Not only in larger *Seeds*,
as in the *Phaseolus* or *French Bean*; but in those which are small, as
in the *Seed* of *Hemp*. In this, the two *Leaves* are both plated, and
so set *Edge* to *Edge*, with mutual *Undulations*. Of that Length, as
to be extended beyond a third part of the *Lobes*.

6. §. In the *Seed* of *Sena*, the *Bud* consisteth of Four *Leaves*; *Tab. 78.* of
which, the greater pair is the outer, and guards the less. Shaped not
much unlike those in the *Seed* of *Carduus*; but are a little more visible.

7. §. In the *Bud* of an *Almond*, we may easily count six, or eight
*Leaves*, and sometimes more; the Inermost being laid bare by a dexterous
*Separation* of the Outer. *Tab. 78.* These are by much the greatest, doubled Inward,
and so laped one over another; whereby they embosome all
the rest, as a *Hen* spreads her *Wings* over her *Chickens*. The like is observable
in many other large *Kernels*, as also in the *Garden Bean*, and
some other *Plants*. With respect to which, I have taken leave⁠[73] to
call this *Part* the *Plume*.

[73]
 *B. 1. Ch. 1.*

8. §. THE LOBES of the *Seed*, and so likewise the *Radicle*
and *Bud* consist of a *Skin*, *Parenchyma*, and *Branched Vessels*: all which
I have formerly described.⁠[74] I shall now add the following *Remarques*.

[74]
 *B. 1. Ch. 1.*

*Tab. 79.*
 9. §. And first of the *Skin*, which in some *Seeds*, as the *French-Bean*
may easily be separated from the *Parenchyma*: especially if the
*Bean* be soaked in water for some days; for then it will slip off, like
the *Skin* in any part of ones *Body* where it is blistered. ’Tis woven
into *Bladders*, as the *Parenchyma*; but into smaller ones, and upon the
*Lobes* of a *Garden Bean*, all radiated towards the *Center*. With
these *Bladders*, there are also mixed a sort of *Lignous Fibres*, incomparably
small, which give a *Toughness* to the *Skin*, and by which the
*Bladders* are directed into *Rays*.

10. §. The *Bladders* of the *Parenchyma*, as is said, are much larger
than those of the *Skin*, especially in the *Lobes*. In those of a *Garden
Bean*, somewhat oval, about ⅛ of an Inch Diametre by their *Bredth*, *Tab. 79.*
and directed towards the *Branches* of the *Seminal Root*. In the *Radicle*,
they are twenty times smaller, than in the *Lobes*: and so in the
*Plume*.

11. §. Throughout the *Parenchyma* run the *Branched Vessels*, *Tab. 79.* which
in the *Lobes* make the *Seminal Root*; in the *Radicle* and *Plume*, the *Wood*
of the *Root* and *Stalk*. In all of them, distributed as hath been⁠[75]
formerly shewed.

[75]
 *B. 1. Ch. 1.*

12. §. I shall here further note, That the utmost divisions are no
where extended to the Circumference of the *Lobes*, *Tab. 79.* but are all inosculated
together at a considerable distance from it, as in the *Leaves* of
some *Plants*.

13. §. In the *Lobes* they all meet in one solid *Nerve*. But in the
*Radicle*, are dilated into a hollow *Trunk*, filled up with a *Pith*; composed
of *Bladders* somewhat bigger than those which make, as it were,
the *Barque* of the *Radicle*. *Tab. 79.* In the *Radicle* of a *French Bean*, the *Pith*
is very conspicuous.

14. §. The *Vessels* are of two kinds, as in the other *Parts* of a
*Plant*; for *Sap*, and for *Aer*. Not running collateral, as *Arteries* and
*Veins*; but the latter every where sheathed in the former. From the
*Aer-Vessels* it is, that if a *Bean* be steeped in water, and then the *Radicle*
cut transversly and pressed, it will yield *Bubles* as well as *Liquor*.
*Tab. 79.* These *Vessels* are admirably small, yet through a very good *Glass* become
visible.

15. §. The *Liquor* conteined in the *Seed*, when full ripe is chiefly
*Oyl*; generally, found in a greater proportion here, than in any other
part of a *Plant*. Being as the *Pickle*, in which the *Seminal Virtues*,
*i. e.* the more *volatile* and *active Principles* of the *Seed*, are immersed
for their *Preservation*: and to curb them from too great a *Luxuriance*
in the *Vegetation* of the *Seed*.
