### CHAP. IV.

### Of the CAUSES of Mixture.

OW
all the *Causes* of *Mixture* we can conceive of,
must, I think, be reduced to these *six* in *general*;
*viz.* *Congruity*, *Weight*, *Compression*, *Solution*, *Digestion*,
and *Agitation*.

1. §. *Congruity*, or aptitude and *respondence* betwixt
the *Sizes* and *Figures* of *Parts* to be *mixed*:
whereby Bodies may be truly called the *Instrumental
Causes* of their own *Mixture*. As when a *Plain* answers to a *Plain*,
a *Square* to a *Square*, a *Convex* to a *Concave*, or a *Less* to a *Greater* or
an *Equal*, &c. according to which *Respondencies* in the *parts* of Bodies,
they are more or less easily *mingleable*.

2. §. *Weight*, by means whereof all *Fluid* Bodies, upon supposition
of the *Congruity* of their parts, must unavoidably *mingle*.

3. §. *Compression*; which either by the *Air*, or any other Body,
added to *Weight*, must, in some degree, further *Mixture*. Because, that
*Weight* it self, is but *Pression*. For further Proof of all the said *Causes*,
I made this *Experiment*; Let *Oyl* of *Aniseeds*, and *Oyl* of *Vitriol*
be put apart into the *Receiver* of an *Air-Pump*. And, having *exhausted*
it of the *Air*, let the *two* said *Oyls* be then affused one upon the other.
Whereupon, *First*, It is visible, that they here *mix* and *coagulate* together;
that is, their parts are *wedged* and *intruded* one into another,
without the *usual compression* of the *Air*; for that is *exhausted*, and
therefore only by the *Congruity* of their receiving and intruding parts;
and by their *Weight*; by *which* alone they are so *compressed*, as to make
that *Intrusion*. *Secondly*, It is also evident, That although they do *Coagulate*;
yet not altogether so much, as when poured together in the
same manner, and quantity, in the *open Air*. Wherefore, *Compression*,
whether made by the *Air*, or any thing else, as it doth further the
*Dissolution* of some Bodies, so the *Mixture* of others, and the greater
the *Compression*, the more.

4. §. *Solution*; For all Bodies *mix* best, in *Forma fluida*. And
that for two reasons. *First*, Because the *parts* of a Body are not then
in a *state* of *Union*, but of *Separation*; and therefore, in a more capable
*state*, for their *Mixture* and *Union* with the *parts* of *another* Body.
*Secondly*, because then they are also in a *state* of *Motion*, more or less;
and therefore, in a continual tendency towards *Mixture*; all *Mixture*
being made by *Motion*. Wherefore all *Generations*, and most *perfect
Mixtures* in *Nature*, are made by *Fluids*; whether *Animal*, *Vegetable*,
or *Mineral*. Which is also agreeable to the *Doctrine* of the *Honourable*
Mr. *Boyle*, in his *Excellent Treatise* of the *Nature* and *Vertues* of *Gems*.
And it is well known, That Bodies are ordinarily *petrified*, or *Stones
made*, out of *Water*. That is, out of *petrifying parts* dissolved *per minima*
in *Water*, as both their *Menstruum* and their *Vehicle*. Wherefore, if we
will talk of *making Gold*; it must not be by the Philosophers *Stone*, but
by the Philosophers *Liquor*.

5. §. *Digestion.* For which there is the same reason, as for *Mixture*,
by *Solution*. For, *First*, All heat doth *attenuate*, that is, still further
*separate* the *parts* of a Body; and so render them more *mingleable* with
the *parts* of *another*. And therefore, *Secondly*, Doth also add more
*Motion* to them, in order to their *Mixture*.

6. §. *Agitation.* Which I am induced to believe a great and effectual
means of *Mixture*, upon divers Considerations. As, *First*, That the
*making* of *Blood* in the *Bodies* of *Animals*, and the *mixing* of the *Chyle*
therewith, is very much promoted by the same means; *sc.* by the *Agitation*
of the parts of the *Blood* and *Chyle*, in their continual *Circulation*.
*Again*, from the *making* of *Butter* out of *Milk*, by the same means:
whereby alone is made a *separation* of the oleous parts from the *Whey*,
and Conjunction of the *Oleous* together. *Moreover*, From the great
*Effects* of *Digestion*; well known to all that are conversant in *Chymical
Preparations*. Which *Digestion* it self, is but a *kind* of *insensible agitation*
of the *parts* of *digested* Bodies. ’Tis *also* a known *Experiment*,
That the readiest way to dissolve *Sugar* in *Wine* or other *Liquor*; is to
give the *Vessel* a *hasty turn*, together with a *smart knock*, against any
*hard* and *steady* Body: whereby all the parts of the *Sugar* and *Liquor*,
are put into a vehement *Agitation*, and so the *Sugar* immediately dissolved,
and *mixed* with the *Liquor*. And I remember, that having (with
intent, to make Mr. *Matthews’s Pill*) put some *Oyl* of *Turpentine* and
*Salt* of *Tartar* together in a Bottle, and sent it up hither out of the
*Country*; I found, that the continual *Agitation* upon the *Road*, for three
or four days, had done more towards their *Mixture*; than a far greater
time of *Digestion* alone had done before. And it is certain, That
a vehement *Agitation*, especially, if continu’d, or joyned with *Digestion*;
will accelerate the *Mixture* of some Bodies, ten times more, than
any bare *Digestion* alone; as may be proved by many *Experiments*. I
will instance in this one. Let some *Oyl* of *Turpentine* and good *Spirit*
of *Nitre* be stop’d up together in a Bottle, and the Bottle held to the
Fire, till the *Liquors* be a little heated, and begin to bubble. Then
having removed it, and the Bubbles by degrees increasing more and
more; the two *Liquors* will of themselves, at last fall into so impetuous
an *Ebullition*, as to make a kind of *Explosion*; sending forth a *smoak*
for the space of almost *two yards* high. Whereupon, the *parts* of both
the *Liquors*, being violently *agitated*, they are, in a *great portion*, *incorporated*
into a *thick Balsam* in a *moment*: and that without any *intense*
heat, as may be felt by the Bottle. And thus much for the *Causes* of
*Mixture*.
