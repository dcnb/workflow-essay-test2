### CHAP. V.

### Of the POWER and USE of Mixture.

![H](images/i_drop_h_019.jpg)
AVING
 enumerated the *general Causes*, we shall,
lastly, enquire into the *Power* and *Use* of *Mixture*;
or, into what it can *Do* and *Teach*. And I shall Instance
in *six* particulars. *First*, to Render all Bodies
*Sociable*, whatsoever they be. *Secondly*, To *Make
Artificial* Bodies in Imitation of those of *Natures* own
production. *Thirdly*, to *make* or *imitate* the *sensible
Qualities* of Bodies; as *Smells*, and *Tasts*. *Fourthly*,
To *make*, or *imitate* their *Faculties*. *Fifthly*, It is a *Key*, to discover
the *Nature* of *Bodies*. *Sixthly*, To discover their *Use*, and the *Manner*
of their *Medicinal Operation*.

INSTANCE I.

F*IRST*, To render all Bodies *Sociable* or *Mingleable*: as *Water*
with *Oyl*, *Salt* with *Spirit*, and the like. For *Natural* and *Artificial
Mixture*, are the same; as we have before proved.
 *Ch. 3. §. 18.* If therefore
*Nature* can do it, as we see in the *Generation* of Bodies she doth, ’tis
likewise in the *Power* of *Art* to do it.

2. §. And for the doing of it, two *general Rules* result from the
*Premisses*, *sc.* The *Application* of *Causes*, and the *Choice* of *Materials*.
As for the *Causes*, they are such as I have now instanc’d in.
 *Ch. 4.* And for
the *Application* of them, I shall give these *two Rules*.

3. §. *First*, That we tread in *Natures* steps as near as we can; not
only in the *Application* of such a *Cause*, as may be most proper for such a
*Mixture*; but also in allowing it *sufficient time* for its *effect*. For so we see
*Nature* her self, for her more *perfect Mixtures*, usually doth. She
maketh not a *Flower*, or an *Apple*, a *Horse*, or a *Man*, in a *moment*;
but all things by *degrees*; and for her more *perfect and elaborate Mixtures*,
for the most part, she requireth *more time*. Because all such
*Mixtures* are made and carri’d on *per minima*; and therefore require a
greater time for the compleating of them.

4. §. A *second Rule* is, Not only to make a due *Application* of
the *Causes*; but sometimes to *Accumulate* them. By which means, we
may not only, *imitate Nature*, but in some cases go beyond her. For
as by adding a *Graft* or *Bud* to the *Stock*, we may produce *Fruit sooner*,
and sometimes *better*, than *Nature* by the *Stock* alone would do: So
here, by *accumulating* the *Causes* of *Mixture*, that is, by joyning *two*,
*three*, or *more* together; or by *applying more* in some Cases, where *Nature*
applyeth *fewer*; we may be able to make, if not a more *perfect*,
yet a far more *speedy Mixture*, than *Nature* doth. As by joyning *Compression*,
*Heat*, and violent *Agitation*, and so continuing them all together,
by some means contrived for the purpose, for the space of a

*Week*, or *Month*, or *longer*, without cessation. Which may probably
produce, not only *strange*, but *useful Effects*, in the *Solution* of some,
and the *Mixture* of other Bodies. And may serve to *mix* such Bodies,
as through the *small number* of their *congruous* parts, are hardly *mingleable*
any other way. *Agitation* being, as carrying the *Key* to and
fro, till it hit the *Lock*; or within the *Lock*, till it hit the *Wards*.

5. §. *Secondly*, For the *Choice* of *materials*, if they are not *immediately*,
that is, of themselves, *mingleable*; we are then to turn one
*Species* of *Mixture* into a *Rule*;
 *Ch. 3. §. 9.* which is, To *mix* them by *mediation*
of some *third*, whether more *simple* or *compounded* Body, which may
be congruous *in part* to them *both*: as *Sulphurous Salts* are to *Water* and
*Oyl*; and are for that reason *mingleable* with *either* of them. Or, By
any *two* congruous Bodies, which are also, *in part*, congruous to *two
others*: and other like ways. Whereby the *parts* of Bodies, though
never so *heterogeneous*, may yet be all *bound* and *lock’d* up together.
Even as *twenty Keys* may be *united*, only by *uniting* the *two Rings*
whereon they hang.

6. §. The Consideration of these things, have put me upon making
several *Experiments*, for the *mingling* of *heterogeneous* Bodies. I
shall give two Examples of Tryal; the one upon *Fluid*, the other upon
*consistent* Bodies.

7. §. For the *first*, I took *Oyl* of *Aniseeds*, and pouring it upon another
Body; I so order’d it, that it was thereby turned into a perfect
*milk-white Balsam*, or *Butyr*. By which means the said *Oyl* became
*mingleable* with any *Winy*, or *Watery Liquor*; *easily*, and *instantaneously
dissolving* therein, in the form of a *Milk*. And *note*, That
this is done, without the *least alteration* of the *Smell*, *Tast*, *Nature*, or
*Operation* of the said *Oyl*. By somewhat the like means, not only
*Oyl* of *Aniseeds*, but any other *stillatitious Oyl*, may be transformed
into a *milk-white Butyr*; and in like manner be *mingled* with
*Water* or any other *Liquor*. Which is of *various use* in *Medicine*; and
what I find oftentimes very convenient and advantageous to be
done.

8. §. Again, not only *Fluid* but *consistent* Bodies, which of themselves
will *mix* only with *Oyl*; by due *mixture* with other Bodies, may
be render’d *easily* dissoluble in *Water*; as may *Rosin*, and all *resinous*
and *friable Gums*. As also *Wax*: and this without changing much
of their *Color*, *Tast*, or *Smell*. Whereof likewise, whatsoever others
may do, the *Physician* may make a manifold *Use*.

INSTANCE II.

BY *Mixture* also, we may be *taught* to *Imitate* the *Productions* of
*Nature*. As to which, from what we have before said of *Mixture*,
we may conclude; That there is no *Generation* of Bodies *unorganical*,
but what is in the *Power* of *Mixture* to *imitate*. As of *Animals*,
to Imitate *Blood*, *Fat*, *Chyle*, *Spittle*, *Flegm*, *Bile*, &c. Of *Vegetables*,
to Imitate a *Milk*, *Mucilage*, *Rosin*, *Gum*, or *Salt*. Of *Minerals*, to
Imitate *Vitriol*, *Allom*, and other *Salts*; as also *Metals*, and the like.

2. §. I do not say, I can do all this: yet if, upon good *Premisses*,
we can conclude this possible to be done; it is one step to the doing of
it. But I will also give an *Instance* of somewhat that may be *done* in
*every kind*. And,

3. §. *First*, For the *Imitation* of an *Animal Body*, I will instance in
*Fat*. Which may be *made* thus; Take *Oyl Olive*, and pour it upon
high *Spirit* of *Nitre*. Then *digest* them for some days. By degrees,
the *Oyl* becomes of the *colour* of *Marrow*; and at last, is *congealed*, or
hardened into a *white Fat* or *Butter*, which *dissolveth* only by the *fire*, as
that of *Animals*. In converting *Oyl* thus into *Fat*, it is to be *noted*,
That it *hardens* most upon the *exhalation* of some of the more *Sulphureous*
parts of the *Spirit* of *Nitre*. Which I effected, well enough
for my purpose, by unstopping the glass after some time of *digestion*;
and so suffering the *Oyl* to *dissolve* and *thicken* divers times by successive
*heat* and *cold*. Hence, The true *Congealing Principle*, is a *Spirit
of Nitre separated from its Sulphur*. For the better doing whereof,
the *Aer* is a most commodious *Menstruum* to the said *Spirit* of *Nitre*.
Whence also, if we could procure such a *Spirit* of *Nitre*, we might *congeal
Water* in the midst of *Summer*. We might also *refrigerate Rooms*
herewith *Artificially*. And might *Imitate* all *frosty Meteors*. For the
*making* of *Fat*, is but the *Durable Congelation* of *Oyl*: which may be
done without *frost*, as I have shewed how.

Hence also it appears, That *Animal Fat* it self, is but the *Curdling* of
the *Oyly* parts of the *Blood*; either by some of its own *Saline* parts;
or by the *Nitrous* parts of the *Aer* mingled therewith.

Hence likewise it is, That some *Animals*, as *Conies*, and *Fieldfares*,
grow *fatter* in *frosty* weather: the *oily* parts of the *blood*, being then
more than ordinarily *coagulated* with a greater abundance of *nitrous*
parts received from the *Aer* into their *bodies*.

For the same reason it is, That the *Fat* of *Land-Animals* is *hard*;
whereas that of *Fishes* is *very soft*, and runs all to *Oyl*, *sc.* Because
the *Water*, wherein they live, and which they have instead of *breath*,
hath but very few *nitrous* parts in it, in comparison of what the *Aer*
hath.

4. §. *Secondly*, For the *Imitation* of a *Vegetable Body*, I will give
three *Instances*; In *Rosin*, *Gum*, and a *Lixivial Salt*. The *first* may
be made thus; Take good *Oyl* of *Vitriol*, and drop it upon *Oyl* of *Anise seeds*;
and they will forthwith *incorporate* together; and by degrees,
will *harden* into a *perfect Rosin*; with the *general* and *defining Properties*
of a *truly Natural Resinous Gum*. Being not at all *dissoluble* in *Water*; or
at least, not any more, then any natural *Rosin* or *Gum*: yet very *easily*
by *fire*: as also highly *inflamable*: and exceeding *friable*. Although this
*Artificial Rosin*, be the result of *two Liquors*, both which very strongly
affect the *Sense*: yet being well *washed* from the *unincorporated parts*,
(which is to be done with some care) it hath scarce any *Tast* or *Smell*.

The *Concentration* of these *two Liquors*, is likewise so *universal*; that
the *Rosin* is not made by *Precipitation*, but almost a *total Combination*
of the said *Liquors*; and that with scarce so much, as any *visible* fumes.

5. §. *Again*, Having taken a certain *Powder* and a *Saline Liquor*,
and mixed them together in a bottle, and so *digested* them for some
time; the *Powder* was at last transmuted to a perfect *Oily Gum*; which
will also *dissolve* either in *Oyl* or in *Water*; in the self same manner, as
*Galbanum*, *Ammoniac*, and the like will do.

6. §. And *Lastly*, A *Lixivial Salt* may be *imitated* thus; Take
*Nitre*, *Oyl* of *Vitriol*, and high *spirit* of *Wine*, of each a like quantity.
Of these *three* Bodies, not any *two* being *put together*, that is to say

neither the *Nitre* with the *Oyl*, nor the *Oyl* with the *Spirit*, nor the
*Nitre* with the *Spirit*, will make the least *Ebullition*: yet all *three mingled
together*, make a very *conspicuous one*. The *Spirit* of *Wine* being as the
*Sulphur*; and so that, and the *Nitre* together, standing, as it were, in the
stead of an *Alkalizate*, that is, a *Sulphurious Salt*, against the *Oyl* of
*Vitriol*. Divers other *Experiments* may be shew’n of the like Nature.

7. §. In the last place, for the *Imitation* of a *Mineral Body*, I will
instance in *two*, *sc.* *Nitre* and *Marine Salt*; if I may have leave to reckon
them amongst *Mineral Bodies*. As for *Nitre*, by mixing of *four Liquors*
together, and then setting them to *shoot*; I have obtained *Chrystals*
of *true* and *perfect Salt*; which have had much of a *nitrous tast*;
and would be *melted* with a *gentle Heat*, as *Nitre* is; and even as easily
as *Butyr* it self: I mean not, by the addition of any sort of *Liquor*,
or any other Body, to *dissolve* it; but only by the *fire*.

8. §. And as for a *Sea-Salt*, that I might *Imitate Nature* for the *making*
thereof, I consider’d, That the said *Salt* is nothing else
but that of *Animals* and *Vegetables*, freed from its true *Spirit* and *Sulphur*,
and some *Saline particles*, *specifically Animal* or *Vegetable*, together
with them. For both *Animal* and *Vegetable* Bodies being continually
carried by all *Rivers* into the Sea; and many likewise by *shipwrack*,
and divers *other* ways *immersed* therein: they are at last *corrupted*, that
is, their *Compounding* parts are *opened* and *resolved*. Yet the *Resolution*
being in the *Water*, is not made *precipitately*, as it is in the *Air*;
but by degrees, and very *gently*; whence the *Sulphurious* and other
*Volatile* parts, in their *Avolation*, make not so much *haste*, as to carry
the more *fixed Saline* parts along with them; but leaveth them behind
in the *Water*, which *imbibeth* them as their proper *Menstruum*.

And the *Imitation* of *Nature* herein, may be performed thus; Put
as much of a *Lixivial Salt* as you please, into a wide-mouth’d Bottle,
and with fair *Water* make a strong *Solution* of it; so as some part thereof
may remain *unresolved* at the bottom of the Bottle. Let the Bottle
stand thus for the space of about half or three quarters of a year, all
the time unstopped. In which time, many of the *Sulphurious* and *other
Volatile* parts gradually flying away; the top of the *unresolved
Salt* will be *incrustate*, or as it were *frosted* over, with many small and
hard *Concretions*, which, in their nature, are become a true *Sea-Salt*.
Whereof there is a double Proof; *First*, In that most of the said *Concretions*
are of a *Cubical*, or very like *Figure*. Especially on their *upper
parts*; because having a *fixed Body* for their *Basis*, their *under* parts,
therefore, contiguous thereto, are less *regular*. Whereas the parts of
the *Salt* in the Sea, being environed on all sides with a *Fluid*; their *Figure*
is on all sides *regular*. *Secondly*, In that a strong *Acid Spirit* or
*Oyl* being poured upon a *full body’d Solution* hereof; yet it maketh
herewith no *Ebullition*, which is also the *property* of *Sea-Salt*. And
thus much for the more *General Imitation* of *Bodies*.

INSTANCE III,
 & IV.

FROM the aforesaid *Premisses*, and by the aforesaid *Means*, there is
no doubt to be made, but that also the other *sensible Qualities* of
Bodies may be *Imitated*, as their *Odors*, and *Tasts*. And that not only
the *general* ones, as *Fragrant*, or *Astringent*: but also those which are
*specifical* and *proper* to such a *species* of Bodies.

2. §. Thus for *Example*, by *mixing Spirit* of *Nitre* or *Vitriol* with
*rectified Oyl* of *Turpentine*, and some other *Vegetable Oyls*, severally,
and in a due *Proportion* and *Time*, I have *Imitated* the *Smells* of *divers
Vegetables*; as of *Tansy*, of *Lignum Rhodium*, and *others*. And I conclude
it feasable, To *Imitate* the *Tast* or *Smell* of *Musk*, or *Ambergreece*,
or *any other* body in the world.

3. §. Hence also we may be *Taught*, How to *Imitate* the *Faculties*,
as well as other *Qualities* of Bodies. The reason is, because even *these*
have no dependance upon any *substantial Form*: but are the meer result
of *Mixture*; effected by the same *Causes*, whether in *Nature* or
*Art*; as I think I have made to appear in the foregoing *Idea*.
*Id. §. 55.*
 *Ch. 2. §. 10.*
 *Ch. 3. §. 10.* And
as in the *Premisses* of this *Discourse* hath been shew’d.

INSTANCE  V.

FROM whence, *again*, it is likewise a *Key* to *Discover* the *Nature*
of Bodies. For how far soever we can attain to *Mingle*, or to
*Make* them, we may also know *what they are*.

2. §. For Bodies are *mingleable*, either *of themselves*, or by some
*Third*. As to those which *mingle of themselves*, we may certainly conclude,
That there is a *congruity* betwixt them, in some respect or other.
So upon various Tryals I find, That *Essential Oyls* do more easily *imbibe*
an *Acid*, than an *Alkaly*. Whence it is evident, That there is
some *Congruity* and *Similitude* betwixt *Essential Oyls*, and an *Acid*, which
there is not betwixt the said *Oyls* and an *Alkaly*.

3. §. As to those that mingle only by some *third*; we may also certainly
conclude, That though the *two extreams* are *unlike*; yet that
they have both of them some *congruity* with that *third*, by which they
are *united*.

4. §. *Moreover*, We may make a *Judgment* from the *manner* or
*Degree* of *Mixture*. Thus the *Acid Spirit* of *Nitre*, as is said, will *coagulate
Oyl-Olive*, and render it *consistent*. Whence it might be thought,
That any other strong *Acid* will do the like; and that therefore, there
is no great difference in the *Nature* of the said *Acid Liquors*. But the
contrary hereunto, is proved by *Experiment*. For having *digested* the
same *Oyl* in the same *manner*, and for a much *longer* time, with strong
*Oyl* of *Sulphur*; although it thence acquired some change of *Colour*, yet
not any *Consistence*.

5. §. *Again*, Because the said *Spirit* of *Nitre coagulates Oyl-Olive*;
it might be expected, it should have the same effect upon *Oyl* of *Aniseeds*;
or, at least, that if other *Acids* will *Coagulate Oyl* of *Aniseeds*,
that this should do it *best*. But *Experiment* proveth the contrary. For
of all I have tryed, *Oyl* of *Vitriol* is the only *Acid* that doth it *instantaneously*.
*Oyl* of *Sulphur*, if very strong, will do it; but not so *soon*,

nor so *much Aqua fortis*, and *Spirit* of *Salt*, for the present, *do not* at
all *touch* it. And *Spirit* of *Nitre* it self will not *coagulate* it, under *eight*
or *ten* hours at least.

INSTANCE VI.

L*ASTLY*, and *consequently*, It is a *Key* To *Discover* the *Medicinal
Use* and *Operation* of Bodies. Thus, for *Example*, by the *Imitation*
of *Rosins* and *Resinous Gums*, we certainly know what all of them
*are*, and *when*, and *wherefore* to be *used*. For what are *Mastick*, *Frankincense*,
*Olibanum*, *Benzoin*, and *other like Rosins*, or *Resinous Gums*, for
their *principle* and *predominant* parts, that is, *quà Rosins*; but Bodies
resulting from *Natural*, in like manner, as I have shewed, they may be
made to result, from *Artificial Mixture*? That is to say, the *Oleous*, and
*Acid* parts of *Vegetables*, being both *affused* and *mingled* together, *per
minima*, in some one sort of *Vessels* in a *Plant*, they thus *incorporate* into
one *consistent* and *friable* Body, which we call *Rosin*.

2. §. Now from hence it is, That the said *Rosins*, and *Resinous
Gums*; as also *Amber* and *Sulphur* for the same Reasons; are of so great
and effectual *Use* against most *thin* and *salt Rheums*; *sc.* as they are
*Acidoleous* Bodies. For by their *Acid* parts, which in all these Bodies
are exceeding *copious*, they *mortifie* and *refract* those *Salt* ones, which
feed the *Rheum*. And by their *oleous* parts, the same *Salt* ones are also
*Imbibed*. Whence, they are all, in some degree, *incorporated* together;
that is, The *Rheum* is *thickned*: which is the desired *effect*.

3. §. Whereas, on the contrary, if the *Cough* proceed not from a
*thin*, and specially a *Salt Rheum*, but from a *Viscous Flegm*; the use of
*many other* Bodies which are also more *oleous*, and abound not so much
with an *Acid* as *these* do, especially *some* of them, is more proper:
such as *these*, in this Case, proving sometimes not only *ineffectual*, but
*prejudicial*. Since the very *Cause* of the said *Viscousness* of *Phlegm*, is
chiefly some great *Acidity* in the *Blood*, or in some other *part*, as may
be proved by divers Arguments.

4. §. Many more *Instances* might be hereunto subjoyned: and may
hereafter be offered to the acceptance of such, who are inquisitive into
*matters* of this *Nature*. If I shall not herein anticipate, or reiterate the
*Thoughts* and *Observations*, of those two *Accurate* and *Learned Persons*
Dr. *Willis*, and Dr. *Walter Needham*, as to what the one hath already
*published*, and both have put us in *Expectation* of. But the *Instances* already
given, are sufficient to evidence what I have said. And, I hope,
this present *Discourse* to prove, in some measure, thus much; That *Experiment*,
and the *Common Notions* of *Sense* are *prolifick*; and that nothing
is *Barren*, but Phansie and *Imagination*.

### An Appendix to the precedent discourse of
    Mixture.

![H](images/i_drop_h_019.jpg)
AVING,
 in the first Edition of the foregoing Discourse,
 *Ch. 5. Inst. 1. §. 8.*
made mention of the preparation of *Essential
Oyls*, so as to become easily mingleable with
any *unoyly Liquor*. I shall here acquaint the Reader,
That this may be done, by digesting any of
the said *Oyls* with about an equal quantity of the
*Yelk* of an *Egg*, with a very soft heat, like that of
the *Meridian Sun* in *Summer*, continued for the
space of three Weeks or a Month; and in the mean time, to be now
and then stirred a little together. The *Yelk* will by degrees, imbibe the
*Oyl*, and at length be incorporated with it, and become a *Balsam*, as
*white* as *Milk*, easily dissoluble in any *watery* or *winy Liquor*.

2. §. I confess, that it will be very difficult to prepare any good
quantity for use, this way. But this being a sufficient proof of the
possibility of such a *Mixture*; I considered, whether the application of
some other forementioned *Cause* of *Mixture*, might not supply the defect
of this: and hereupon, have made several successful tryals; not
only for the mixing of the said *Oyls*, but likewise of all sorts of *Rosins*
and *Gums* with any *winy* or *watery Liquor*, in great quantities, in a
short time, and without much trouble. But for the mixing of some of
them, the *Yelk* of an *Egg* alone will not serve, without the intervening
of some other sociable Body,
 *Ch. 5. Inst. 1. §. 6.* according to one of the *Rules* given
in the foregoing *Discourse*.

3. §. In the same *Discourse*, upon certain premises, I have laid
down this following conclusion.
 *Ch. 5. §. 5.*

“—— By accumulating the *Causes* of *Mixture*, that is, by joyning
two or three or more together; or by applying more in some cases,
where *Nature* applyeth fewer; we may be able to make, if not a more
perfect, yet a far more speedy *Mixture*, than *Nature* doth. As by joyning
COMPRESSION, *Heat*, and *violent Agitation*, and so continuing
them altogether, by some means contrived for the purpose, for
the space of a Week or Month, or longer without *Cessation*. Which
may probably produce, not only strange, but useful effects, in the
SOLUTION of some, and the *Mixture* of other *Bodies*.”

4. §. For the proof whereof, and that I had throughly weighed
what I have said, Mr. *Pappin* hath since given us an ingenious Instance,
in his new *Digester*. Which is, a *Balneum Mariæ clausum*: all *Infusions*
and *Digestions* made with *Double Vessels*, having hitherto been made
with the outer *Vessel*, open. So that whereas by the old way of *Digestion*,
there is no other *Power* made use of but that of *Heat*: in this
way, that also of *Compression* is joyned therewith.

*HE
 intent of the following* Experiments *is two-fold.
    The one, to be as a* Demonstration *of the
    Truth of one, amongst other* Propositions, *laid
    down in the precedent Discourse of* Mixture,
 *Ch. 5. Inst. 5.* *sc.*
    That it would be a Key to let us easily into the
    knowledge of the Nature of Bodies.

*The other, and that consequently,* To be as a
    Specimen of a Natural History of the Materia
    Medica: *that is to say, a multifarious Scrutiny
    into the intrinsick Properties of all those Materials, which have been, or
    may be used in* Medicine: *for the performance whereof, the following* Method
    *is exhibited as one, amongst others, necessary to be insisted upon.
    For what Dominion a* Prince *hath over the* Moral, *that a* Physician *hath,
    as one of God Almighty’s* Vice-Roys, *over the* Corporeal *World. Whom
    therefore nothing can more import, than a particular knowledge of the* Genius
    *of all his* Subjects, *those several* Tribes *of* Matter, *supposed to be
    under his Command.*

*There are some known* Observations *of this nature: but there is no Author,
    I think, who hath given us a* Systeme of Experiments upon the
    Subject: *The performance whereof is here intended.*

*The* Experiments *may seem too numerous to be of one* make. *But no
    less a number would have answered the design of an* Universal Survey;
    *which, though less pleasing, proves the more instructive in the end: not being
    like angling with a single Hook; but like casting a Net against a shole:
    with assurance of drawing up something. Besides the advantage of* comparing
    many together; *which being thus joyned, do oftentimes, like*
    Figures, *signifie ten times more, then standing alone, they would have
    done.*

*How far the* Corollaries *all along subjoyned have made this good, is
    left to the* Reader *to judge. And also, to add to them, so many more, as
    he pleases: for I make my own Thoughts no mans* Measure.
