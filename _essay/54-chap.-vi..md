### CHAP. VI.

### Of the USE of the Parts to the Fruit.

![I](images/i_drop_i_153.jpg)

N
 the forgoing *Descriptions*, I have already mention’d
the *Use* of the *Parts* in some particulars. I shall now
a little further explain the manner of their service,
both to the *Fruit*, and to the *Seed*.

2. §. And first, the *Vessels* serve for the *Figuration*
of the *Fruit*. So in an *Apple*, the Ten great and
utmost *Branches* serve not only to nourish and feed
it; but also, by the *Arched Lines* they draw, to direct and govern the
*Growth* thereof into an orbicular *Figure*. The *Dilatation* of these
*Vessels*, not being hindred by any *Braces* or *Conjunction* with the *Interior*
ones. By the *Slenderness* of the *Aer-Vessels*, as in the *Root*, so
here in the *Fruit*, much promoted. And by their *Saline Principle*,
first begun.

3. §. The Five midlemost and the Five Inmost serve together, to
figure the *Coar*; the former bounding the Outer, the Latter, the Iner
*Angles*. For were they only Five, or were all Ten in the same *Circle*,
they would only make a round *Cavity* like that of a hollow *Pith*.
Hence it is that *Apples*, in which some small *Threds* of the *Vessels* strike
out into the *Circumference*, are very Uneven with divers *Knobs* and
*Ridges*. But *Plums*, *Cherries*, &c. where the *Vessels* all terminate at
an Equal distance from the *Skin*, are Even all round about.

4. §. The *Bulk* of the *Fruit* dependeth also on the *Braces* of the
*Vessels*. For in *Plums* and *Cherries*, they are more numerous; but in
*Apples* and *Pears* they are very loose one from another, and so have liberty
left them to spread abroad.

5. §. As also on their *Size*; that is, on the *Size* of the *Aer-Vessels*.
Which, the less they are themselves, they serve to make a bigger *Fruit*.
As the less they are in any *Root*, they serve to make it the more ample.
For the less they are, the more pliable to the *Attraction* of the *Aer*:
and in their *Growth* must make so many more spiral *Rings*: by both
which means, they make the greater *Arches*. And therefore a *Pear* is
commonly a smaller *Fruit* than an *Apple*; a *Plum* than a *Pear*; and a
*Grape*, than a *Plum*; in all which the *Aer-Vessels* are still greater and
greater.

6. §. From the same Cause, it is also most agreeable, That the
*Fruit* should not come before the *Leaves* or *Flower*, but last of all. For
the *Aer-Vessels*, as hath been often noted, are not exactly *Cylindrick*,
but tapered; that is, not only the *Fibres* consisting of divers of these
*Vessels*, but the *Vessels* themselves, as they ascend into the *Trunck*,
*Branches*, *Leaves*, *Flower*, and *Fruit*, grow still more and more slender.
So that the smallest coming last, and being the most pliable; they are
also best accommodated for the *Expansion* of the *Parenchyma* into that
we call the *Fruit*.

7. §. It is likewise a proper Question to be asked, How it comes
to pass, That some *Plants* bear a *Fruit*, and not all? I answer, That
as the *Size* of the *Aer-Vessels* conduceth to the *Bulk* of the *Fruit*, and
the Order of its Growth: So the *Number* of them, to there being, or
not being, any *Fruit* at all. For the *Fruit*, as we have already defined
it, is an *Uterus*, which grows moyster and softer, as the *Seed*
ripens. The reason therefore, why the *Uterus* in some *Plants*, continues
moist and soft after the *Seed* is ripe; and in some, dries up; is,
Because in the former, there is a smaller, in the latter, a greater *Quantity*
of the *Aer-Vessels* in proportion to the other *Parts* of the *Uterus*,
and so a greater quantity of *Aer*. Which as in the *Pith* of most *Plants*,
so here, by degrees excludes the *Sap*, or rendering it more evaporable,
comes in the room of it; and so the *Uterus* is dryed up: that is, there
is no *Fruit* produced, but only a *Seed-Case*.

8. §. From the *Size*, *Number*, and *Position* of all the *Vessels* in *Fruits*
a reason also may be given, for the diversity of their *Tasts*. Some Instances
have before been given; to which I shall add one or two more.
So the *Rind* of an *Orange*, is bitter; the *Pulp*, sower. Because the
former is furnished with many *Lignous Vessels*, the *Sulphureous* or *Oyly
Tincture* whereof, being copiously mixed with the *Acid* of the *Parenchyma*,
produce that *Tast*. Whereas the *Pulp*, which is very sower, is
void of all manner of *Vessels*. But if the *Sap-Vessels* are either less numerous
or less *Sulphureous*; they give so mild a *Tincture* to the *Parenchyma*,
as not to produce a bitter, but a sweet or soft *Tast*; as in *Apples*, *Grapes*,
*Goosberries*, &c. And of a *Goosberry*, it is particularly to be noted,
that whereas, in a *Limon*, the *Pulp* only is sower, as being void of
*Vessels*: here, on the contrary, the *Pulp* only is sweet, whereinto all
the *Vessels* strike, and the *Rind* sower.

9. §. The diversities of the *Skin* it self, have their *Use*. And therefore,
the more tender and delicate the *Fruit* is; the *Skin*, on the contrary,
is thicker and more tough. So *Apples* have a thicker *Skin*, than
*Pears*; *Plums*, than *Apples*; and *Grapes* than *Plums*; those having as
it were, only a *Coat* of *Kid*, but this of good thick *Buff*. And therefore
some *Fruits*, although tender, yet either not having so rich a
*Juyce*, or coming early, and so not being exposed to excessive heats,
have a very thin *Skin*, as *Mulberries*, *Strawberries*, &c.
