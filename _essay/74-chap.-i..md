and a MARINE Salt, out of the LIXIVIAL
Salt of a Plant.

OMETIME
since, I took the boldness to present
my thoughts to this Honourable and Learned
Body in a *Discourse* concerning *Mixture*. Wherein
I have endeavoured to lay such a *Foundation*, as
might hereafter reduce the *Doctrine* hereof to *Experience*
and *Practice*; and to demonstrate, the *Power*
and *Use* of *Artificial Mixture*. And in further proof
of what is therein asserted, I have since made a continuation of *Experiments*
upon the same Subject, in Two *Methods*. One in the *Mixture*
of several *Menstruums*, both *Acid* and *Alkaline*, with all Sorts of
*Bodies*. The Other, by calcining them, or, as it were, *mixing* them
with the *Fire*.

2. §. I shall now proceed to a Third, which is, the *mixing* them
with the *Aer* or exposing them to it; another of Natures grand *Menstruums*;
which goes sometimes further than the *Fire* it self, in the dissolution

of Bodies. This I have formerly mentioned for the Imitation
of *Nature*, in producing a *Marine* or *Muriatick Salt* out of the *Lixivial
Salt* of a *Plant*.
 *Discourse* of *Mixture* Ch. 5. Inst. 2.
But some Learned Persons then present, seeming to
doubt of the Experiment; I thought it requisite to prosecute the same
a little further; that so, if possible, it might become clear and unquestionable.
And because that *Method* was imperfect, and required half a
year, or a longer time: I bethought my self of an other way; which
proved far better, and more expedite. And which, withall, afforded
me, not only a true *Marine Salt*, out of the *Lixivial Salt* of a *Plant*;
but also another kind of *Salt*, different from them both: which may
not be improperly called, an *Essential Salt* or *Nitre* of *Plants*. The
History or manner of the production of them both, is as follows.

3. §. *December 15. 1675*, I took about half a pound of a strong
*Solution* of the *Lixivial Salt* of *Firne*: and pouring it into an *Earthen
Pan*, well glazed, broad and shallow, exposed it therein to the open
*Aer*, in a Chamber Window, to evaporate of it self. *Tab. 83.*

4. §. This *Solution* or *Lee*, although it was very clear before, and
having stood corked up in a bottle many days, had no sedement: yet
standing now in the open *Aer*, within the space of 4 or 5 days, it began
to let fall a very *white Sedement*, like fine *Chalk*; which encreased daily
for 8 or 10 days; amounting at last to about half a Drachm of white,
light and meer *Earth*, altogether insipid, and when it was well washed,
stirring not upon the *Affusion* of *Acids*.

5. §. Within the space of a day or two after this *white Sedement*
began to fall to the bottom; there was also gathered on the top, a
kind of soft *Scum* or *Cremor*, wherewith the *Solution* was covered all
over.

6. §. Within 8 or 9 days after the first exposing of the *Liquor*, or
2 or 3 days after the gathering of the *Cremor*; that *Salt*, which I take
leave to call, an *Essential Salt* of *Plants*, began to appear; shooting
into several little *Crystals*. These *Crystals*, as they grew bigger, began
to sink, and at last fell down to the bottom of the *Pan*.

7. §. Upon their first generation or shooting, the said *Cremor* presently
breaks, leaving a bare space round about each *Crystal*; and upon
the bounds of every space is indented; *Tab. 83.* the space growing bigger and
bigger together with the *Crystal* in the Centre. And so, by that time
the *Crystals* are grown to a considerable number and bigness, the *Cremor*
vanishes away, the several *Circles* or bare places breaking at last
one into another all over the *Surface* of the *Lee*. After which, it never
comes again.

8. §. From whence it seemeth, That the several *Circles* or bare
*Spaces* about the *Crystals*, are made for the more free admission of the
*Aer*, requisite to their *Generation*. For as there is no *Crystal* begins to
be formed before there is a breach made in the *Cremor*: so that breach
is enlarged together with the *Crystal*. So that as the falling of the
*Sedement* and the gathering of the *Cremor*, sheweth that the *Aer*, as a *Menstruum*
separates some part from the *Lee*: so the breaking of the *Cremor*
afterwards, that as a *Vehicle*, it brings something to it: both in order
to the *Generation* of the *Crystals*. *Nature* taking a *Method* for the *Generation*
of simpler Bodies, as well as of those which are *Compounded* and
*Organical*.

9. §. The *Figure* of these *Crystals* is angular and oblong, most of
them about the fifth, sixth or seventh of an Inch; but none of them
very regular. Yet we are not hence to conclude, but that with the
help of some Circumstances which might be wanting in the shooting of
these; some portion of regular ones may be obteined from this, as well
as other *Lixivial Salts* hereafter mentioned.

10. §. They are somewhat transparent, and of a dark *Ambar Color*,
or like that of brown *Sugar-Candy*. Of a quite different *Taste*
from that of the *Solution* or *Lee* out of which they are bred; being not
at all *Lixivial*, but very weak and mild; not *Salt*, but *Bitter* in a
good degree.

11. §. It is also observable, that *Alkaline* and *Acid Salts* being both
poured severally upon these *Crystals*, they stir not, nor are any way
affected with either of them. So that these *Crystals* are no sort of *Tartar*,
or *Tartareous Salt*. As is plain, from the manner of their *Generation*;
*Tartar* being still bred in close *Vessels*; these never, but by exposing
the *Liquor* to the *Aer*. As also from their *Taste*, being not sower,
in the least, but bitter. And in that *Tartar* will make a *Bullition* with
*Alkaline Salts*, which these will not do. Upon which accounts it appears,
that they are a *Salt* different in Nature from all other *Salts*
hitherto known, or a new *Species* added to the *Inventory* of *Nature*.

12. §. These *Crystals* within the space of about a fortnight after
their first *Generation*, did also cease to shoot any more, but only increased
a little in their *Bulk*. After which time, I dayly expected to
see the production also of a true *Marine Salt*. And about two months
after the said *Essential Crystals* had done shooting, and not before, this
also began to shoot, in many small *Crystals*, and at the top of the *Solution*,
as the other did, still falling to the bottom as they grew
biger.

13. §. The *Size* of most of them was near that of the *Flakes* or
*Grains* of *Bay-Salt*. The *Colour* of some of them *white*, of others *transparent*;
and of others *white* in the *Centre*, with transparent *Edges*; as
is also usual in the *Crystals* of *Common Salt*.

14. §. The *Figure* of most is a perfect *Square*, and of very many
coming near to a *Cube*; which is also the *Figure* of *Common Salt*, and
seldome an exact *Cube*. An exact *Cube*, being the constant property of
no *Marine Salt*, that I know of, except that of the *Dead Sea*. *Tab. 83.* Divers
of them were also raised as it were by several steps from a deep Centre
to the Top: as is often seen in the common shooting of *Common Salt*;
and not in any other. Their *Taste* is neither *Lixivial*, as that of the
*Solution* out of which they shoot; nor bitterish, as that of the *Essential
Crystals*; nor sowerish, as that of *Tartar*; but the perfect *Taste*
of *Common Salt*.

15. §. It is also to be noted, That if *Oyl* of *Vitriol*, and some other
strong *Acids*, be poured upon this artificial *Sea-Salt*, they make an *Effervescence*
together: but if *Spirit* of *Salt* or *Spirit* of *Nitre* either be
poured on it, though it be never so strong it stirreth it not. In both
which, and all the formentioned respects, it answers to the *Properties* of
a *Marine* or *Common Salt*, which no other *Salt* doth. I conclude it therefore
to be a true *Marine Salt* produced by *Art* in the imitation of *Nature*.
