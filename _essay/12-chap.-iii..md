### Of the BARQUE.

![N](images/i_drop_n_198.jpg)
EXT
WITHIN the *Skin* lieth the *Barque*.
’Tis sometimes Yellow, as in *Dock*; Red, in *Bistort*;
but usually, and in *Seed-Roots*, I think, always
White. It is derived from the *Seed* it self; being
but the extension or prolongation of the *Parenchyma*
of the *Radicle*; One of the three *Organical
Parts* of the *Seed*, described in the *First* **Chapter**
of the *First* **Book**.

2. § It is variously Sized; sometimes very Thin, as in *Jerusalem
Artichoke*, *Goats-beard*, and in most *Trees*; where it also retains the
Name of a *Barque* or *Rind*. Sometimes ’tis more Thick, and maketh up
the far greatest portion of the *Root*, as in the String-*Roots* of *Asparagus*,
in *Dandelion*, and others. The thinnest and the thickest are all analogous,
and obtain the same general Uses. The degrees of its Size,
amongst all *Roots*, may be well reckoned about Twenty, and seen in
the following examples,
 *Tab. 7, 8, 9.* *sc.* *Beet*, *Dropwort*, *Jerusalem Artichoke*,
*Orpine*, *Valerian*, *Goats-beard*, *Nettle*, *Brownwort*, *Columbine*, *Celandine*,
*Asparagus*, *Horse-Radish*, *Peony*, *Bryony*, *Eryngo*, *Borage*, *Lovage*,
*Dandelion*, *Parsnep*, *Carrot*, *&c.* In the *Root* of *Beet*, scarce exceeding
a good thick *Skin*: but in a *Carrot*, half the Semidiameter of the *Root*,
or above half an Inch over in some places: and that of *Dandelion*, sometimes,
in proportion with the *woody Part*, twice as thick: the rest of
Several intermediate Degrees: And to most *Roots*, this is common,
To have their *Barque* proportionably thicker, at the bottome than at
the top.

3. §. IT IS Compounded of two *Bodies*. The one *Parenchymous*;
Continuous throughout; yet somewhat Pliable without a solution of
its Continuity. Exceeding Porous; as appeareth from its so much
shrinking up, in drying. The *Pores* hereof are extended much alike
both by the length and bredth of the *Root*; therefore it shrinketh up,
by both those Dimensions, more equally. And they are very Dilative;
as is also manifest from its restorableness to its former bulk again, upon

its infusion in Water: that is to say, *It is a most curious and exquisitely
fine wrought Sponge.* Thus much the Eye and Reason may discover.

4. §. The *Microscope* confirms the truth hereof, and more precisely
shews, That these *Pores* are all, in a manner, Spherical, in most *Plants*;
and this *Part*, an Infinite Mass of little *Cells* or *Bladders*. The sides of
none of them, are Visibly pervious from one into another; but each is
bounded within it self. *Tab. 10, & sequent.* So that the *Parenchyma* of the *Barque*, is much
the same thing, as to its Conformation, which the Froth of *Beer* or
*Eggs* is, as a fluid, or a piece of fine *Manchet*, as a fixed Body. The
Sides also of these *Bladders* are as transparent, as those of Water; or
the Bodies of some *Insects*.

5. §. But their Size is usually much smaller; and their Posture more
Regular than those in *Bread* or *Water*. In all *Roots* they are so small,
as scarcely, without the *Microscope*, to be discerned: yet are they of
different Size, both in the same, and in divers *Roots*; the varieties
whereof, amongst all *Roots*, may be reduced to about Ten or Twelve
according to the *Standard*, in *Tab. 11.*
 *Tab. 13, 14.* Some of those in *Dandelion*,
being of the Smallest; and in *Bugloss*, of the Greatest. They are posited,
for the most part, at an Equal Height; and piled evenly one over
another: So that, oftentimes, they visibly run in Ranks or trains,
both by the length and breadth of the *Roots*, as in the *Root* of *Bugloss*, or
of *Dandelion*, split through the middle, may be seen. Although they are
usually Spherical, yet sometimes, and in some places, they are more
oblonge, *Tab. 14.* as in the outward part of the *Barque* of *Bugloss*. These *Bladders*,
are sometimes best seen, after the *Root*, being cut traverse, hath layn
by awhile, to dry.

6. §. They are the Receptacles of *Liquor*; which is ever Lucid;
and I think, always more Thin or Watery. They are, in all *Seed-Roots*,
filled herewith; and usually, in those also which are well
grown, as of *Borage*, *Radish*, &c.

7. §. THIS *Parenchymous Part*, in many *Roots*, is of one Uniform
*Contexture*; as in *Asparagus*, *Hors-Radish*, *Peony*, *Potato*, and others.
In many others, it is, as it were, of a Diversified *Woof*; the *Bladders*
being, though every where Regular, yet either in Shape, Size, or
Situation, different in some Parts hereof, from what they are, in other
intermediate ones. For these Parts, are like so many White *Rays*,
streaming, by the Diameter of the *Root*, from the inward Edge toward
the Circumference of the *Barque*; as in Lovage, Melilot, Parsnep, &c.
cut transversly, is apparent. *Tab. 8, 9.* They are, though not in direct Lines,
continued also by the length of the *Root*; so that they are, as it were,
so many *Membrances*, by which the other Parts of the *Barque*, are disterminated.

8. §. The Continuation of these Diametral *Rays*, or *Portions*, is
divers: sometimes, but half through the *Barque*, or somewhat more,
or less, as in *Melilot*. *Tab. 9.* And it is probable, that to the *Roots* of all or
most *Trefoyls*, and also of the *Leguminous* Kind, this is proper, To have
their Diametral *Rays* come short of the Circumference. *Tab. 8.* Sometimes,
they run quite through to the very *Skin*, as in *Lovage*. And I think,
in the *Roots* of all Umbelliferous *Plants*: In which therefore, the *Skin*
seems to have a closer Communion with the Diametral *Rays*, and to be
originated especially therefrom. They usually stand at an Equal Distance
in the same *Root*: But with respect to divers *Roots*, their Distance

varies;*Tab. 7, 8.* so less, in *Parsnep*, greater in *Bugloss*. They are commonly
Rectilinear, as in *Lovage*; *Tab. 8.* but sometimes winding to and fro, as in
a *Carrot*.

9. §. They are not always of one Size: in a *Carrot* near the
Inner Edge of the *Barque*, exceeding Slender, and scarcely discernable;
in others, Thicker, as in the Three greater ones of *Melilot*, and
in common *Chervil*. *Tab. 8, 9.* Both by their Distance, and Size, they are also
less or more Numerous; some, only as they are nearer; some, as smaller;
others, as both. And ’tis proper, I think, to the *Intybous* kind,
either to have none, or but a few. Sometimes they are of the same
Thickness quite, through the *Barque* from edge to edge, as in *Marsh-Mallow*. *Tab. 7.*
And sometimes are considerably spread or dilated as they
aproach the *Skin*, wherewith they are joyned, and whereinto they
more visibly run, as in *Parsley*, or the smaller part of the *Root* of
*Lovage*. *Tab. 8.* And in some *Roots*, as of *Scorzonera*, at some times of the
year, when less succulent, almost the whole *Parenchyma* seems to be
of the Nature of the Diametral *Rays*, in other *Roots*. The *Bladders*
of these Diametral *Portions*, are sometimes, greater than those of the
other *Parenchymous Parts*, as in *Parsley*; and I think sometimes less.
Yet as there, so here, variously sized; to about six or eight Degrees;
and those of *Parsley* about the third, fourth, and fifth. Their
Figure is Sometimes more oblong; and their direction or respect more
towards the Center of the *Root*.

11. §. As the other *Parenchymous Parts* of the *Barque*, are the
Receptacles of *Liquor*; so these, (where they are) of *Aer*. This is argued,
From their being more White, and not Transparent, as such
*Roots* and *Parts* use to be, which are more copiously and equally filled
up with *Liquor*: as the *Pith* of *Elder*, which, in the old *Stalks*, is
White; was once, and by being well soaked, will become, again
Transparent. And from their being more dry and voyd of *Liquor*;
whereupon their *Bladders*, which cannot be Vacuities, must be filled
with more or less *Aer*, mixed with the *Sap* or the *Vaporous* parts thereof.
This is more observable in those Diametral *Portions*, which terminate
upon, and run into the *Skin*.

12. §. THE BARQUE is not only of a divers *Woof*, but as is
said, of a Compounded Substance; there being a certain number of
*Lignous Vessels*, fewer or more, in some place or other, mixed with
the *Parenchymous Part* above described; and some way or other, are
demonstrable in all *Roots*. As by the Toughness of the *Barque*, when
pulled by the length. By the visible Continuation of the said *Vessels*
through the length of the *Barque*, in the resemblance of small *Threds*. *Tab. 6.*
And by the rising up of the *Sap* in the traverse cut of the *Root*, in
such places of the *Barque*, where these *Threds* terminate: as the existence
of the same *Vessels* in the *Skin*, was proved in the *Precedent*
**Chapter**.

13. §. These Tubulary *Threds*, run not through the *Barque* in direct
lines; but are frequently Braced together in the form of *Net-Work*;
The *Parenchymous Parts* every where filling up the spaces betwixt
the Braced *Threds*; *Tab. 6.* as in *Burnet*, *Scorzonera*, &c. the *Barque*
being paired or striped off, is apparent.

14. §. They seem, at first, where they are Braced, to be Inosculated;
so as to be pervious one into another. But a more accurate
view, especially assisted by a *Microscope*, discovers the contrary. Neither
are they woun’d any way one about another, as Threds are in a Rope:
nor Implicated, as in ravled Yarn, or the Knots of a Net: but only
contiguous or simply Tangent, as the several Chords in the Braces of
a Drum: being thus joyned together by the *Parenchymous Parts*, as in
speaking of the *Pith*, will be understood how. Yet do not always the
same *Threds* belong and keep entire to one *Brace*; but are frequently
parted into lesser *Threds*; which are transposed from *Brace* to *Brace*.
Nor do they always, in whole or in part, presently after their contingence,
mutually fall off again; but, oftentimes, run along collaterally
joyned together for some space.

*Tab. 6.* 15. §. These *Braces* are of various number in divers *Roots*; more
frequent in *Jerusalem Artichoke*, less in *Scorzonera*, more rare in *Cumfry*.
The *Threds* likewise are variously Divaricated; sometimes more, where
the *Braces* are frequent, as in *Jerusalem Artichoke*; and sometimes less,
where the *Braces* are rare, as in *Scorzonera*, *Dandelion*: And in all
*Roots*, more frequent towards the Inner Verge of the *Bark*.

16. §. By what is said, it is partly implied, That these *Threds*, are
not Single *Vessels*; but a *Cluster* of them, Twenty, Thirty, or more or
fewer of them together. Yet as the *Threds* are not Inosculated in the
*Braces*; so neither are the *Vessels*, in the *Threds*. Nor yet Twisted;
but only stand collateral together; as the several Single *Threds* of the
*Silkworm*, do in Sleave-Silk. Neither are these *Vessels* pyramidal, so far
as the *Glass* will discover; or, from probable Reason, may be conjectured.
Nor Ramified, so as to be successively propagated one from
another, after the manner of the *Veins* in *Animals*: but Cylindrical,
and Distinctly continued, throughout the length of the *Root*; as the
several *Fibres* in a *Tendon* or *Nerve*.

17. §. THESE VESSELS are either themselves of divers kinds, or
serve, at least, to constitute divers Kinds, in divers *Roots*: of the different
Natures whereof, although there may be other ways whereby to
judge; yet so far as by Inspection, we may do it, chiefly, by the Diversity
of those *Liquors*, which they severally contain. Sometimes they
yield a *Lympha*; and that Thin, as they do in a *Parsnep*; especially
those that make a *Ring*, at the inward extremity of the *Bark*. See the
Root it self. That this Clear *Sap* ascendeth only from these *Vessels*, is
certain. Because no *Liquor* will do the like, from any *Parenchymous
Part*, as *Chap. 2.* hath been said. And because it is of a different
nature from the *Sap* contained in the *Bladders* of the *Parenchyma*; although
of the same *Colour*, yet sensibly more *Sweet*.

18. §. Sometimes they yield a Thick and Mucilaginous *Lympha*, as
in *Cumfry*, as appeareth by its tenacity. From the Mucilaginous *Content*
of these *Vessels* it is, I suppose, that the *Sap* contained in the *Bladders*
is rendred of the like nature, so far as it approaches hereto, which
sometimes is more, as in *Marsh-mallow*; and sometimes but little as in
*Borage*: For in pressing out the *Liquor* of this *Plant*, and then heating
it over an indifferent fire; the far greater part hereof remaineth thin;
only some certain strings and little bits of a gellied substance are mixed
herewith; which as it seems, were originally the proper *Liquor* of these
*Muciducts*.

19. §. Oftentimes these Succiferous *Vessels* yield a *Milky* or White
*Sap*; and sometimes Yellow, and of other colours as in *Sonchus*,and most
*Cichoraceous Plants*; in *Angelica*, and most *Umbelliferous*; in *Burdock*,
and divers *Thistles*, to which that is ’akin: in *Scorzonera*, *Common
Bells*, and many other *Plants*, not commonly taken notice of to be
*milky*. The *Milky Saps* of all which, although they differ in Colour,
Thickness, and other Qualities; yet agree, in being more *Oyly* than
any of the *Lymphous Saps*. It being the mixture of the *Oyly* parts with
some other Limpid *Liquor*, but of a different Nature, which causeth
them to be of a *Milky*, or other *Opacous* Colour, in the same manner
as common *Oyl*, and a strong *Liquamen* of Tartar, shaked in a Bottle
together, presently mix into a White *Liquor*. And although they
will, for the greatest part, separate again; yet some of their parts,
without any Boiling, or so much as the least Digestion with Heat, by
Agitation only, or standing together for some time, incorporate in the
form of a Thin *Milky-Sope*, which will also dissolve in *Water*. I suppose,
therefore, That it is the *Volatile Salt*, chiefly, of these *Plants*,
which being mixed with their *Oyl*, renders this *Liquor* of a White or
other Opacous Colour.

20. §. Sometimes the *Oyl* will separate and discover it self: for if
you cut a *Fenil-Root* traverse, after it hath layn some days out of the
Ground; the same *Vessels*, which, in a fresh *Root*, yields *Milk*; will
now, yield Oyl: the watery parts of the *Milk*, which in the drying
of the *Root* are more evaporable, being spent.

21. §. All *Gums* and *Balsams* are likewise to be reputed the proper
*Contents* of these *Vessels*: for These and *Milks*, are very near akin.
So the *Milk* of *Fenil*, upon standing, turns to a Clear *Balsam*; of
*Scorzonera*, *Dandelion*, and others, to a *Gum*. In the dryed *Root*
of *Angelica*, &c. being split, the *Milk*, according to the Continuation
of these *Vessels*, appeareth, as Blood clodders in the *Veins*, condensed
to an hard and shining *Rosin*. *Tab. 9.* And the *Root* of *Helenium* cut
transversely, presently yields a curious *Balsame* of a Citrine Colour,
and sometimes of the Colour of *Balsame* of *Sulphur*. I call it a *Balsame*;
because it will not dissolve in Water. Yet not a *Terebinth*;
because, nothing near so viscid or tenaceous as that is. But the *Root*
of Common *Wormwood*, bleeds, from large *Vessels*, a true *Terebinth*, *Tab. 10.* E. or a
*Balsame* with all the defining properties of a *Terebinth*; although that
word be commonly used only for the Liquors of some *Trees*.

22. §. There is yet another kind of *Sap-Vessels*, which may be called
*Vapour-Vessels*; as in *Docks*, at least some of them. For by the
*Sap-Vessels* it is, that the *Barques* of *Roots* do *Bleed*. Of which, some
Bleed quick and plentifully, as the *Umbelliferous* and the *Cichoraceous*
Kinds. Some, very slowly and scarce visibly, as all or most *Trefoyls*,
and of the *Leguminous* Kind. And some seem not to *Bleed*, as the
*Dock*. Yet that this *Root*, hath also *Vessels* distinct from those that
carry *Aer*; doth partly appear, from the different Colour they produce
where they stand; as will better be understood anon, in speaking
of the Causes of the *Colours* of *Roots*. As also from the Toughness
of the *Barque*, in pulling it by the length; neither the *Parenchyma*,
nor the *Aer-Vessels*, being of themselves *Tough*. But because the *Succus*
or *Sap* they carry, seems to be a kind of Dewy *Vapour*, therefore, they
may not improperly be called *Roriferous* or *Vapour-Vessels*.

23. §. THE *Sap-Vessels*, are not only of divers Kinds, in divers
*Roots*, but in the same. Whether in all, I doubt: but in some it is
certain they are: *Tab. 9.* For if you cut a *Fenil-Root* traverse, both *Milk* and
*Limpid Sap*, will presently ascend, and, upon accurate inspection,
appear thereupon distinctly. So the *Roots*, both of *Trachelium* and
*Enula*, Bleed both a *Lympha*, and a Citrine *Balsame*: and *Wormwood*,
both a *Lympha*, and a *Terebinth*, at the same time. So also the *Root*
of *Dandelion* being cut in *November*, seems to bleed both a *Milk*
and a *Lympha*; the latter being drowned by the former at another
time when it is more copious. Whether all *Roots* have *Lymphæducts*,
is doubtful; but ’tis most probable, that they have, more or fewer;
standing, for the most part, in a *Ring*, at the Inner Verge of the
*Barque*: the *Sap* whereof, I suppose, is so far of common Nature in
all *Roots*, as to be Clear, and less Oily.

24. §. THE Quantity of these *Vessels* is very different: In *Borage*,
*Peony*, *Bistort*, but few; in *Asparagus*, fewer: in *Parsnep*, *Celandine*,
many; in *Fenil*, *Marsh-mallow*, many more: and betwixt these extreams,
there are many Degrees, *Tab. 7, 8, 9.* as by comparing the *Roots* of *Horse-Radish*,
*Turnep*, *Briony*, *Skirrets*, *Parsley*, *Goats-Beard*, and as many
more as you please, may be seen. Amongst the several Sorts of *Docks*,
they seem in *Patience*, to be the fewest; in *Red-Dock*, the most numerous.
There are two ways of judging of their Number; Either
as their Extremeties are visible upon the traverse cut of the *Barque*;
or as the *Barque* is diversly Brittle or Tough; being so, from the various
Number of these *Vessels* therein, as in the *Second Chapter* hath
been said.

25. §. The Quantity of the ascending *Sap*, is a doubtful argument,
whether of the Number, or Size of these *Vessels*. For it is
common to most *Milky-Roots*, for the *Milk* to ascend more copiously:
yet in some of them, the *Vessels* seem, in proportion with the *Parenchymous
Part*, not to be so numerous, as in some other *Roots*, where
the ascending *Sap* is less; as by comparing the *Lacteals* of *Dandelion*,
and the *Lymphæducts* of *Fenil* together, may appear: so that it should
seem, that the bore of the *Lacteal Vessels*, is greater than that of the
*Lymphæducts*.

26. §. THE Situation of these *Vessels*, as they appear, even to
the naked Eye, in the transverse Section, is Various and Elegant.
Sometimes they are posited only at the Inner Edg of the *Barque*, where
they make a Ring, as in *Asparagus*. *Tab. 7, 8, 9, & 10.* In which place and position, they
stand in most, if not in all, *Roots*, how variouslly soever they are posited
also otherwise. The Common *Crow-Foot* with numerous *Roots*,
hath a *Ring* of *Sap-Vessels* next the *Skin*. So the *Barque* of *Monks-Hood*,
is encompassed with a transparent *Ring* of *Sap-Vessels*. The
*Ring* is either more Entire, as in *Eryngo*, *Brown-Wort*, *Valerian*, *Hop*,
*Madder*, *&c.* Or it is a Prick’d *Ring*, as in *Buttyr-Bur*. Sometimes
they are chiefly postur’d in a Prick-Ring, towards the outward part of
the *Barque*, as in *Peony*: and some *Roots* are pricked all over the
*Barque*, as of *Melilot*. In others, they stand not so much in Pricks,
as Portions or *Colums*, as in *Cumfry*.

27. §. In others, again, they all stand in more continued Lines,
either Rays or Diametral, as in *Borage*; or Peripherial, as in *Celandine*.
The *Vascular* Rays are not equally extended in all *Roots*: in
*Parsnep*, towards the Circumference of the *Barque*;
 *Tab. 7, 8, 9.* in *Bugloss*, about
half way. In all *Docks*, and *Sorrels*, the *Rays* are extended through
about ¾ of the thickness of the *Barque*, towards the Circumference,
whereabout, divers of them are always *arched* in, two and two together.
In all or many *Trefoyls*, and of the *Leguminous* Kind, they are
extended through no more than ⅓ᵈ of the *Barque*. In the *Umbelliferous*,
they are Ralled in betwixt the Diametral *Portions* of the *Parenchyma*.
In *Borage*, the Rays are more Continuous; in a *Carrot*, more
Pricked. Here also the Pricks stand in Even Lines; in *Lovage*, they
are Divaricated. Of which, and those of some other *Roots*, it is also
Observable, That they are not all meer Pricks, but most of them
small, yet real Circles; *Tab. 8.* which, after the *Milk* hath been frequently
licked off, and ceaseth to ascend, are visible, even without a *Glass*.
And note, that in observing all *Milk-Vessels*, the *Milk* is to be taken off,
not with the Finger but the Tongue; so often, till it riseth no more,
or but little. And some *Roots* may also be soaked in Water; whereby
the Position of the *Milk-Vessels*, will be visible by the darker Colour
of the *Barque*, where they stand.

28. §. The Rays sometimes, run more Parallel, and keep several,
as in *Monkshood*; and sometimes, towards the Circumference of the
*Barque*, they are occurrent; *Tab. 7, 8, 9.*
 as not only in *Docks*, but other *Plants*:
In *Eryngo*, in a termination more Circular; and in *Bryony*, angular,
or in the form of a *Glory*, as also in *Horsradish*, through a *Microscope*. *Tab. 15.*
The Peripherial Lines are in some, more entire Circles, as in *Dandelion*;
in others, made up of shorter Chords, as in *Potato*, *Cumfry*, and the
smaller part of the *Root* of *Monks-hood*. In some, the Pricks are so
exceeding small, and stand so close, that, to the bare eye, they seem
to be continuous *Rings*, which yet, through the *Microscope*, appear
distinct, as in *Marsh-mallow* and *Liquirish*. *Tab. 12.*

29. §. Sometimes Columns and Chords are compounded, as in
*Burnet*; Pricks and Chords, in *Potato*; Rays and Rings, in *Monkshood*;
where the Ring is Single. In *Fenil*, there is a double or treble
order both of Rays and Rings, the *Lymphæducts* standing in Rays and
the *Lacteals* in Rings. And in *Marsh-mallow*, the *Vessels* are so posited
as to make both those kinds of Lines at once.

30. §. In *Celandine*, they seem all, to the bare eye, to stand in
numerous Rings lying even one within another. As also in *Dandelion*;
in which yet, being viewed through a *Microscope*, *Tab. 13.* there is an appearance
of very many small Rays; which streaming from the Inner Verge
of the *Barque*, cross three or four of the smaller Rings, and are there
terminated. Whence it should seem that *Lymphatick* Rays and *Milky*
Rings, are in that *Root*, so far mixed together. Only the *Lympha*, being
confounded with the *Milk*, cannot be discerned. And where the
*Milky-Vessels* are evacuated, or at such Seasons, wherein they are less
full, divers *Milky Roots* will yield a clear *Liquor* at the Inner Verge of
the *Barque*, where, at other times, they seem to yield only *Milk*.
And this is the Description of the *Barque*.
