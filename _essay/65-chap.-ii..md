### Of the Principles of Bodies.

first, by *Principles*, I mean *Atomes*, or certain
*Sorts* of *Atomes*, or of the *simplest* of *Bodies*. For
otherwise they would not be *Principles*; for a
*compounded Principle*, in strict speaking, is a *Contradiction*.
Even as *Fives*, *Threes*, or *Two’s* are
not the *Principles* of *Number*, but *Unites*.

2. §. Whence, secondly, it follows, that they
are also *Indivisible*. Not *Mathematically*; for the *Atomes* of every *Principle*
have their *Dimensions*. But *Physically*; and so, what is but *one*,
cannot be made *two*. If it be asked, Whether a Stick cut with a Knife,
be not of one, made two? I say, that a Stick, is not *one* Body, but
*many millions* of Bodies; that is, of *Atomes*; not any one whereof is
*divided* within it self, but only they are *separated* one from another,
where the Knife forceth its way. As in the drawing of a mans Finger
through a Heap of Corn; there is no *Division* made in any one
*Grain*, but only a *separation* of them one from another, all remaining
still in themselves entire. I say, therefore, that what is *Physically
one*, is also most firm, and *Indivisible*, that is, *Impenetrable*: for *Penetration*
is but the *Separation*, not the *Division* of *Atomes*.

3. §. Hence, thirdly, they are also *Immutable*. For that which
cannot be *divided*, cannot be *chang’d*. So that of the whole World
of *Atomes*, not any one hath ever suffer’d, or can suffer the least *mutation*.
Hereupon is grounded the *Constancy* of *Causes* and *Effects*. So
that, in all *Generations*, it is not less certain, that the self same *Principle*
is still *propagated* from the same; than, that *Man* is from *Man*.
Wherefore, *compounded Bodies* are *generated*; but *Principles* are not,
but only *propagated*; that is, in every *Generation*, they pass, in themselves
unaltered, from one Body, into another.

4. §. If *Principles*, or *Atomes* are all *Immutable*; it again follows,
That they are of *Divers Kinds*. For one and the same *Principle*, or *Kind*
of *Atomes*, will still make the *Same* Thing, and have the *same Effect*: so
that all *Generations* would then be the *Same*. Wherefore, since they
are *Immutable*, they must be *Divers*.

5. §. This *Diversity*, for the same reason, is not small, but very
*Numerous*. For as the *World*, taken together, is *Natures Shop*; so the
*Principles* of Things are her *Tools*, and her *Materials*. Wherefore, as
it speaks the *goodness* of a *Shop*; so the *Perfection* of the *Universe*, That it
is furnished with many *Tools* wherewith, and many *Materials* whereupon
to *work*. And consequently, that *Philosophy* beareth best its own name;
which doth not strain all to two or three *Principles*, like two or three

Bells in a Steeple, making a pitiful *Chime*: but tryeth to rise up to
*Natures* own *Number*, and so to *ring* all the *Changes* in the World.

6. §. Yet doth not this vast *Diversity* take away the *Regiment* and
*Subordination* of *Principles*. There being a certain lesser *number* of
them, which either by their greater *quantity*, or other ways, have
*Rule* and *Dominion*, in their several *Orders*, over all the rest. For
where-ever the *Subject* is *Multitude*, *Order* is part of its *Perfection*. For
*Order* is *Proportion*. And how can *Nature* be imagin’d to hold *Proportion*
in all things else, and not here? Wherefore, as certainly, as *Order*
and *Government* are in all the Parts of the *Rational*; so certainly,
of the *Material World*. Whence it is, That although the *Species* of
*Principles* be very *numerous*; yet the *Principles* called *Galenical*, *Chymical*,
or any others, which do any way fall under the notice of
Sense, are notwithstanding *reduceable* to a *smaller number*: *viz.* according
to the *number* of *Predominant Principles* in *Nature*; or, rather in this part
of the *Universe* which is *near and round about us*. To the *Power* and
*Empire* whereof, all other *Principles* do submit. Which *Submission*, is
not the *quitting* of their own *Nature*; but only their appearance under
the external Face or *Habit* of the said *Predominant Principles*.

7. §. As there can be no *Order* of *Principles*, without *Diversity*;
so no *Diversity*, but what is *originally* made by these two ways; *sc.* by
*Size* and *Figure*. By *these* they may be exceeding different: and all
other *Properties* besides, whereby they differ, must be *dependent* upon
*these Two*.

8. §. Nor therefore, can they be of any other *Figures*, than what
are *Regular*. For *Regularity, is a Similitude continu’d*. Since therefore
all kinds of *Atomes* are *divers* only by their *Size* and *Figure*; if
the selfe same *Size* and *Figure* were not *common* to a certain number of
*Atomes*, they could not be said to be of any *one kind*: and consequently,
if there were no *Similitude* of *Atomes*, there could be no *Distinction*
of *Principles*.

9. §. Hence also, these two *Modes* of *Atomes*, *viz.* their *Size* and
*Figure*, are the true, and only *original Qualities* of *Atomes*. That is,
an *Atome* is *such* or *such*, because it is of such a certain *Size* and *Figure*.

10. §. Lastly, As these two *Modes*, taken severally, are the *Qualities*
of an *Atome*: so consider’d together, they are its *Form*. A *Substantial
Form* of a *Body*, being an unintelligible thing. I say of a
*Body*; for although the *Rational Soul* be a *Substantial Form*, yet is
it the *Form* of a *Man*, and not of a *Body*. For the *Form* of a *Body*,
we can conceive of no otherwise, than as of the *Modification* of a *Body*,
or a *Complexion* of all the *Modes* of a *Body*. Which also agrees with
that *Definition* of a *Form*, which amongst the *Peripatetick Philosophers*
is well enough accepted, *viz.* *Quod sit, Ratio ejus Essentiæ, quæ cuique Rei
competit*. Which *Ratio*, if it be referred to a *Body*, what is it, but the
*Modification* of that *Body*? Having thus proposed a Summary of my
*Thoughts* about *Principles*; I shall next proceed to shew what their
*Mixture* is.
