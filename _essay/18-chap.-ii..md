### CHAP. II.

### Of the Barque, as it appears through a good Microscope.

![I](images/i_drop_i_153.jpg)

NOW proceed to a more particular *Description* of
several *Trunks* and *Branches*, as they appear through
good *Glasses*.

1. §. Now the *Trunk*, or *Branch* of every *Tree*,
hath Three General *Parts* to be described; *sc.* the
*Barque*, the *Wood*, and the *Pith*. That likewise of
every *Herbaceous Plant*, hath either the same Three
*Parts*; or else Three *Parts* Analogous; *sc.* the *Cortical*, the *Lignous*,
and the *Pithy Parts*.

2. §. The *Barque* consisteth of two *Parts*, *sc.* the outmost or *Skin*,
and the *Main Body*. The *Skin* is generally composed, in part, of very
small *Vesicles* or *Bladders*, cluster’d together. That is, originally it is
so; but as the *Plant* grows, the *Skin* dries, and the said *Bladders*, do
very much shrink up and disappear.

3. §. Amongst these *Bladders* of the *Skin*, there are usually intermixed
a sort of *Lignous Fibres*, or *Vessels*, *Tab. 20.* which run through the length
of the *skin*; as in *Mallow*, *Nettle*, *Borage*, *Thistle*, and most *Herbs*. Which
is argued not only from the Toughness of the *skin* by means of the said
*Vessels*; but in some *Plants*, may be plainly seen, as in *Teasle*. In which,

the several *Fibres*, which run by the length of the *Stalk*, are also conjoyned
by other smaller ones, which stand transversly.

4. §. Whether they are *Aer-Vessels*, or *Sap-Vessels*, is dubious. For,
on the one hand, because they emit no *Sap*, or *bleed* not, and also stand
adjacent to the *Aer*; ’tis probable that they are *Aer-Vessels*. On the
other hand, they may be *Sap-Vessels*; notwithstanding that they *bleed*
not: Because the non-emission of *Sap* is not an infallible and concluding
argument of an *Aer-Vessel*. For there are some *Plants* which *bleed* not.
Which yet are furnished with *Sap-Vessels*, as certainly as any others
which *bleed*.⁠[58]

[58]
 *B. 2. P. 1. c. 3. §. 22.*

5. §. The *Skin* of the *Trunk* is sometimes visibly porous. But no
where more, than in the better sort of walking *Canes*; where the
*Pores* are so big, as to be visible even to the naked Eye: like to those,
*Tab. 20.* which are observable in several parts of the Ball of the *Hand*, and upon
the ends of the *Fingers* and *Toes*.

6. §. THE *Main Body* of the *Barque* consisteth likewise of two
*Parts*, *sc.* *Parenchyma*, and *Vessels*. The *Parenchyma* is made up of an
innumerable company of small *Bladders* cluster’d together. Differing
in nothing from those aforesaid in the *Skin*; *Tab. 22. & Sequent.* saving, that they are much
larger; and generally rounder.

7. §. This *Parenchyma* of the *Barque* is the same, as to its *Substance*,
both in the *Root* and *Trunk*. Yet as to the *Texture* of its *Parts*,
in the *one*, and in the *other*, there *is* This observable difference, *viz.*
That in the *Barque* of the *Root*, cut transversly, the said *Parenchyma*
(as hath been shew’d) is usually, more or less, disposed into *Diametral
Rays*; *Tab. 7, 8, 9.* running through the *Barque*, after the same manner, as do the
*Hour-Lines* through the Margin of the *Dial-plate* of a *Clock* or
*Watch*: as in *Marsh-Mallow*, *Lovage*, *Melilot*, and others. Whereas
here in the *Barque* of the *Trunk*, the said *Parenchyma* is rarely thus
disposed into *Diametral Rays*: *Tab. 22. & Seq.* Nor when it is, are those *Rays* continued
to the Circumference of the *Barque*; as in the *Barque* of the *Root* they
frequently are. *Tab. 31, 34, &c.* So in *Rhus* or *Sumach*, although part of the *Parenchyma*
be dispos’d into *Diametral Rays*: yet are those *Rays* extended
not half way through the *Barque*. So also in *Fig-tree*, *Worm-wood*,
*Thistle*, and others. What is further observable in the *Texture* of the
*Parenchyma*, I shall shew in the description of the *Pith*.

8. §. THE *Vessels* of the *Barque*, are, as I shall also shew, diversifyed
many ways. But there are some Things, wherein, in all Sorts
of *Plants*, they agree. *First*, in standing, most numerously, in or near,
the inner Margin of the *Barque*. *Secondly*, in being always, and only
*Sap-Vessels*. I have viewed so many, that at least, I can securely affirm
thus much, That if there be any Heteroclital *Plants*, wherein they are
found otherwise, there is not *One*, in *Five Hundred*. *Thirdly*, in being
always *Conjugated* or *Braced* together in the form of *Net-work*. Although
the Number and Distances of the *Braces*, are very different:
 *Chap. 3.  
Tab. 6.* as
I have already shewed in the *Anatomy* of *Roots*.

9. §. THE Properties, whereby the said *Vessels* of the *Barque* are
specificated and distinguished one from another, both in the same
*Plant*, and in the several Species of *Plants*, are very many. Which
Properties, are not Accidental, but such as shew the Constant and
Universal Design of *Nature*. All which shall be demonstrated by the
*Description* of several *Quarters* of the *Slices*, of so many Kinds of

*Branches*, cut Transversly: and by the several *Figures* which represent
them.

10. §. FIRST then, for the *Eleven* first *Quarters*, the *Vessels* of
the *Barque* are only of *Two Kinds*. *Tab. 22. & Seq.* And these, in the first *Eight*, seem
to be *Roriferous* (described also in the *Anatomy* of *Roots*)⁠[59] and
those which are common to most, if not to all *Plants*, sc. the *Lymphæducts*.
Yet in all the *Eight*, they are, in respect both of their *Proportion*,
and *Position*, very different. So in *Hazel* and *Ash* they are but
few. In *Holly* and *Barberry* more. In *Apple*, *Pear*, *Plum*, *Elm*, still
more numerous. And of those three *Fruits*, in an *Apple*, or *Plum*,
more than in a *Pear*.

[59]
 *P. 1. c. 3. §. 22.*

11. §. Again, as their *Proportion*, so likewise their *Position* is divers.
For in *Holly*, the *Lymphæducts* or inner *Vessels* next to the *Wood*,
stand in *Rays*. Yet so numerous and close together, as to make one
Entire *Ring*. *Tab. 22, 23, 24.* In *Hazel*, they stand more in Oblong *Parcels*. In *Barberry*,
they stand likewise in *Parcels*, but they are so many *Half-Ovals*.
The utmost *Vessels* or *Roriferous* of all Three, make a *Ring*.

12. §. Again, in *Apple*, *Pear*, and *Plum*, the *Lymphæducts* are *Radiated*.
The *Roriferous* are neither *Radiated*, nor make an *entire Ring*;
 *Tab. 25, to 28.*
but stand in *Peripherial Parcels*. Much after the same manner, they
also stand in *Elm*. In *Ash*, the *Vessels* make Two *Rings*; *Tab. 29.* but neither
of them *Radiated*: the inmost *Ring* or *Lymphæducts*, consisting of *Arched
Parcels*, and the utmost or *Roriferous Vessels*, of *Round* ones.
And whereas in all the foregoing, the *Lymphæducts* are still contiguous
to the *Wood*; and the *Roriferous* more or less, distant from the *Skin*:
here, on the contrary, the former are distant from the *Wood*, and the
latter contiguous to the *Skin*.

13. §. And that these *Vessels* in each *Barque* of the said Eight *Branches*,
are of Two distinct Kinds, seems evident, as from some other reasons,
so from hence; In that their *Positions* are altogether Heterogeneous:
Yet in both Constant, Regular and Uniform. I say, there seems to be
no Reason, why the self *same Kind* or Species of *Vessels*, should have
a different, yea a contrary *Position* in one and the same *Plant*; and that
Contrariety, not *Accidental*, but *Regular* and *Constant*.

14. §. FOR the *Three* next *Quarters* *sc.* the *Ninth*, *Tenth* and
*Eleventh*, the *Vessels* of the *Barque* are also different in *Number*, *Position*,
*Size* and *Kind*. *Tab. 30, 31, 32.* In *Pine*, which is the *Eleventh*, they are fewer. In
*Walnut*, the *Ninth*, more. In *Fig*, the *Tenth*, most numerous.

15. §. So for their *Position*. In *Pine*, the inmost make a *Radiated
Ring*. The utmost stand *stragling* up and down, without any certain
order. In *Wallnut* the inmost make also a *Radiated Ring*; The utmost
make a Double *Ring*; not *Radiated*, but of *Round Parcels*.
In *Fig*, the inmost make also a *Radiated Ring*. But the utmost make
a *Double* and sometimes *Treble Ring*, not of *Radiated*, nor *Round*, but
*Arched Parcels*.

16. §. Thirdly, they are also different in *Kind*. Those, I think,
of the two former, *Wallnut* and *Fig*, are thus different: those certainly,
of the *Fig*, are so; being *Lymphæducts* and *Lacteals*. The *Lymphæducts*
make the inmost *Radiated Ring*. The outmost which make the
other *Rings* in *Arched Parcels*, are the *Lactifers*.

17. §. That they are distinct *Kinds* of *Vessels*, is evident for two
Reasons. *First*, from their *Position* in the *Barque*; which is altogether

different, as hath been said. *Secondly*, from the most apparent
Diversity of the *Liquors* or *Saps*, which they contain, and which, upon
cutting the *Branch* transversly, do distinctly *Bleed* from them. Which
is one way, whereby we do distinguish the *Vessels* of *Animals* themselves.
As in the *Liver*, it were hard to say, which is a *Blood-Vessel*, and which
is a *Bile-Vessel*, where they are very small, if it were not for the *Contents*
of them both.

18. §. Those in the *Barque* of *Pine*, are likewise of Two *Kinds*.
The inmost are *Lymphæducts*, as in the two former. The utmost are
not *Milk-Vessels*, but *Gum-Vessels*, or *Resiniferous*; which stand stragling,
and singly, about the midle of the *Barque*. Out of these *Vessels*
all the clear *Turpentine*, that drops from the *Tree*, doth issue.

19. §. Few, but very great. So that besides the difference of their
*Number* and *Position*, and of the *Liquors* which they contain, and *Bleed*;
there is yet a Fourth, and that is, their *Size*. Most of these *Turpentine
Vessels*, being of so wide a *bore*, as to be apparent to the naked Eye:
and, through a good *Glass*, above ⅓ᵈ of an Inch in Diametre.
Whereas that of the *Lymphæducts*, can hardly be discovered by the best
*Microscope*.

20. §. The same *Turpentine-Vessels* of *Pine*, are likewise remarkably
bigger, not only than the *Lymphæducts*, but many times, than the
*Milk-Vessels* themselves: as those of the *Fig*, which, in comparison, are
exceeding small; every *Arch*, not being a *single Vessel*, but a *Parcel* or
*Cluster* of *Vessels*; Whereas one single *Gum-Vessel* in *Pine*, is sometimes
as big as two whole *Arched Clusters*, that is, as some Scores of the *Milk
Vessels* in a *Fig-tree*. And the said *Gum-Vessels* of *Pine*, being compared
with the *Lymphæducts* of the same *Tree*, one *Gum-Vessel*, by a moderate
estimate, may be reckoned *three* or *four hundred* times *wider* than
a *Lymphæduct*. The like prodigious difference may be observed in the
*Size* of the several *Kinds* of *Vessels* of many other *Plants*.

21. §. THE *Three* next *Quarters* of *Branches*, are of *Oak*, *Common
Sumach*, and *Common Wormwood*. In the *Barque-Vessels* whereof,
there is observable some farther Variety. For in all or in most of the
above named, there are only Two *Kinds* of *Vessels* in the *Barque*. But
in Each of these, there are, at least, Three *Kinds*.

22. §. And first, in that of *Oak* there are *Lymphæducts*, *Roriferous*,
and a Sort of *Resiniferous*. *Tab. 33.* The inmost or *Lymphæducts*, make a
*Radiated Ring*, contiguous to the *Wood*. The utmost or the *Roriferous*
make also a *Ring*, but not *Radiated*. Those which are a sort of
*Rosin-Vessels*, stand in Round *Parcels*; the greater *Parcels* betwixt the
Two *Rings* of *Roriferous* and *Lymphæducts*; and the lesser, betwixt
the *Roriferous* and the *Skin*.

23. §. That these last are different *Vessels* from both the other, seems
evident, from the difference of their *Position*, as aforesaid. And that
they are a sort of *Resiniferous*, is argued from hence; In that, not
only *Galls* are very full of *Rosin*, but that the *Barque* of *Oak* it self is
also somewhat *Resinous*. For the conveyance of whose *Resinous* parts, it
is most unlikely that any other *Vessels* should subserve, but a peculiar
*Kind*; which may therefore be properly called *Resiniferous*.

*Tab. 34.* 24. §. The next is a *Branch* of *Common Sumach*. In the *Barque*
whereof, there are likewise Three *Kinds* of *Vessels*. First of all, there
is a thick *Radiated Ring* of *Lymphæducts*; standing on the inner *Margin*

of the *Barque*, contiguous with the *Wood*. These *Vessels* exhibit
their *Lympha* very apparently. A second kind of *Vessels*, *sc.* *Roriferous*,
are situate towards the outer *Margin* of the *Barque*, and are composed
into distinct *Arched Parcels*, all standing in a *Ring*.

25. §. Betwixt these Two *Kinds* stand the *Milk-Vessels*. Every
single *Milk-Vessel* being *empaled* or hemmed in with an *Arch* of *Roriferous*.
The *Milk-Vessels* are extraordinary large, almost as the *Gum-Vessels*
of *Pine*; so as distinctly to be observed without a *Microscope*;
after they are evacuated of their *Milk*; and without difficulty will
admit a *Virginal Wyer*; being two or three hundred times as big as a
*Lymphæduct*. Besides these Three sorts of *Vessels*, there is also a *Ring*,
adjacent to the *Skin*; which seems to be another sort of *Roriferous*.

26. §. The Last, is a *Branch* of *Common Wormwood*. *Tab. 35.* In the
*Barque* whereof, there are likewise Three *Kinds* of *Vessels*. First of
all, there is a thin *Radiated Ring* of *Lymphæducts*, contiguous with the
*Wood* or on the inner *Margin* of the *Barque*. Yet the *Ring* is not entire,
but made up of several *Parcels*; which are intercepted by as many
*Parenchymous* inserted into the *Pith*.

27. §. A Second Sort of *Vessels*, which seem to be *Roriferous*, are
situate about the middle of the *Barque*: and are composed into *Arched
Parcels*, which likewise stand all even in a *Ring*.

28. §. Beyond these *Arches*, and towards the outer *Margin* of the
*Barque*, stand a Third Sort of *Vessels*. Different from the *Milk-Vessels*
in *Sumach*, both as to their *Situation*, *Size* and *Content*. For in
*Sumach*, the *Milk-Vessels* stand within the *Arched Lymphæducts*: whereas
these in *Wormwood*, stand without them. Likewise, being the *Vessels*
of an *Herb*, they are far less; *sc.* about the compass or width of a small
*Wheat-Straw*. Their *Content*, is not a *Milk*, but a *liquid*, most *Oleous*
and *viscid Gum*. Or which, for its pleasant *Flavour* may be called an
*Aromatick Balsom*. For it perfectly giveth whatever is in the *Smell*
and *Taste* of *Wormwood*: being the *Essence* of the whole *Plant*, which
nature treasureth up in these *Vessels*. So that they are, in all respects,
analogous to the *Turpentine Vessels* in *Pine*. There are divers other
*Herbs* and *Trees*, which in the like *Vessels*, contain a *Turpentine*, or rather
*Aromatical Balsom*; as *Angelica*, *Helenium* and others; the *Vessels*
being so very large, that they may be easily traced with a knife, in cutting
by the length of a *Branch* or *Stalk*.

29. §. Whether in some *Plants*, there are not more *Sorts* of *Vessels*,
in the *Barque*, than have been now mentioned, I cannot say:
Though we have not much reason to doubt of it. Because we see,
there is so great variety in the *Viscera* of *Animals*. For what the
*Viscera* are in *Animals*; the *Vessels* themselves are in *Plants*.

30. §. CONCERNING the *Form* and *Texture* of the *Lymphæducts*,
there are some things, which though they are best observed in the
*Wood*, yet in regard I am now describing the said *Vessels*, I shall here
therefore add. I have already said, and shewed, in the former *Books*,
That the *Lignous* and *Towy Parts* of all *Plants*, are *Tubulary*. And
that the *Lympha* is conveyed, by the length of a *Plant*, through an innumerable
company of small *Tubes* or *Pipes*.

31. §. The *Question* may be yet further put: If the *Towy Parts* of
the *Barque* are made of *Tubes*, What are these *Tubes* themselves made
up of? *I answer*, That these *Tubes* or *Lymphæducts*, are not only

themselves *Organical*; but their very *Sides* also, seem to be composed
of other *Parts*, which are *Organical*, *sc.* of *Lignous* or *Towy Fibres*.
*Tab. 40.* Which *Fibres*, standing close or contiguous in a round *Figure*, they
make one *Tubulary Body*, which I call the *Lymphæduct* of a *Plant*. And
it is probable, That these *Fibres* themselves, are also *Tubulary*. That
is, that a *Lymphæduct*, is a small *Tube*, made up or composed of
other, yet much smaller *Tubes*, set round together in a *Cylindrick Figure*.
As if we should imagine a company of *Straws*, which are so
many small *Pipes*, to be joyned and set round together, so as to make
another greater *Pipe*, answerable to a *hollow Cane*. The *Cane*, I say,
is as the *Lymphæduct*; and the *Straws* are as the *Fibres* whereof it is
composed. By which also appears, the admirable smallness of these
*Fibres*. For there are some *Lymphæducts*, which may be reckoned fifty
times smaller than a *Horse-Hair*. Allowing therefore but Twenty of
the aforesaid *Fibres* to make a *Thred* so big as one *Lymphæduct*; then
one of the said *Fibres*, must be a Thousand times smaller than a *Horse-Hair*.
That these *Fibres*, whereof the *Lymphæducts* are made, are
themselves made up of other *Fibres*, is not altogether improbable.

32. §. These *Fibres*, although parallel; yet are they not *coalescent*,
but only contiguous; being contained together in a *Tubulary Figure*,
by the Weftage of the *Cortical Fibres*, as in *Chapter* the *Fourth* will
better be understood.

33. §. The first notice I took of the *Composition* and *Texture* of
these *Vessels*, so far as the best *Glasses* yet known, will admit; was in
a very *white* and *clear* piece of *Ash-wood* torn, with some care, by the
length of the *Tree*, and objected to a proper *Light*. They seem also
sometimes discernable in some other *clear Woods*, as in very *white Fir*,
*&c.* And having formerly demonstrated, that the *Lignous Part* of a
*Plant*, is annually made or augmented out of the inner part of the
*Barque*, wherein the *Lymphæducts* always stand: we may reasonably
suppose the same *Lymphæducts* to have the like Conformation in the
*Barque*, as in the *Wood*.

34. §. And I am the rather induced to believe, that I am not mistaken
in this Description, upon these two Considerations. *First*, that
herein the Analogy betwixt the *Vessels* of an *Animal* and a *Plant*, is the
more clear and proper. For as the *Sanguineous Vessels* in an *Animal*
are composed of a number of *Fibres*, set round, in a *Tubulary Figure*,
together: so are these *Lymphæducts* of a *Plant*. *Secondly*, in that herein,
there is a more genuine respondence betwixt these, and the other
*Vessels* of a *Plant* it self; *sc.*, the *Aer-Vessels*; which are made up of a
certain number of *Round Fibres*, standing collaterally, or side to side
as I have already observed in the *Anatomy* of *Roots*. So that it is the
less strange, that the *Lymphæducts* should be made up of *Fibres*, since
the *Aer-Vessels* are evidently so made. Only with this difference, that
whereas in the *Aer-Vessels*, the *Fibres* are postured or continued *Spirally*:
here, in the *Lymphæducts*, they stand and are continued only
in *straight Lines*.

35. §. THE STRUCTURE of the *Lactiferous* and *Gum-Vessels*, which
have a very ample *Bore*, is more apparent. *Tab. 20.* And, by the best *Glasses*
I have yet used, they seem to be made, chiefly, by the Constipation
of the *Bladders* of the *Barque*. That is to say, That they are so many

*Chanels*, not made or bounded by any walls or sides proper to themselves,
as a *Quil* thrust into a *Cork*, and as the *Aer-Vessels* are in the
*Wood*: but only by the *Bladders* of the *Parenchyma*; which are so
postured and crouded up together, as to leave certain *Cilyndrick Spaces*,
which are continued by the length of the *Barque*.

36. §. One difference betwixt the *Vessels* or *Chanels* now describ’d,
and the Tubulary *Hollows* and other *Apertures* in the *Pith*, is this;
That these never exist originally with the *Pith*; but are so many *Ruptures*
supervening to it in its Growth. Caused, partly, by the Stretch or
Tenter it suffers from the Dilatation of the *Wood*:⁠[60] and partly, the
drying, and so the Shrinking up of its *Bladders*, and of the *Fibres*
whereof they are composed. Whereas the said *Vessels* in the *Barque*,
are many of them originally formed therewith. And those which are
*post-nate*, not made by any *Rupture*, but only such a Disposition of
the *Parenchymous Fibres*, and Constipation of the *Bladders*, as is thereunto
convenient.

[60]
 *B. 1. c. 3. §. 22, & 23.*

37. §. In paring the *Barque* of a *Branch* of *Pine*, *Sumach*, &c. they
appear, neither *parallel*, nor any where *Inosculated*: but run, with
some little obliquities, distinct one from another, through the length
of the *Branch*: and so, we may believe, through the length of the
*Tree*.
