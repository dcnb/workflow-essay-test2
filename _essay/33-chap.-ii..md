### CHAP. II.

### Of those things which appear upon the Surface
    of the Leaf.

![T](images/i_drop_t_148.jpg)
HESE
are *Globular Excrescences*, *Spots*, *Hairs*,
*Thorns* and *Prickles*: of all which, except *Spots*,
I have spoken in the *Appendix* to the *Chapter* of
*Leaves* in the *First* **Book**.

2. §. Of the *Globulets*, it may here be further
noted, That those which are white, and lie
sometimes like a fine Powder upon the *Leaf*,
were once transparent, as in *Bears-Ear*; their
cleer *Liquor* being now evaporated to an *Extract*
of *White Flowers*. *Tab. 43.* This, if licked off, will give you the *Tast* of the
more *Essential Content* of the *Plant*; different from that perceived in
chewing the *Leaf*.

3. §. For the observing of them, it may also be noted, That although
they often grow on both sides the *Leaf* alike; yet sometimes,
as in *Ground-Ivy*, only or chiefly on the Back-Side. And that in many
*Plants*, where the elder *Leaves* have none; on the young *Buds* they are
very numerous; as in *Corin Tree*, *Sorrel*, and others.

4. §. AS for *Spots*, the smaller ones are observable not only in
*St. Johns-worts*, (in which *Plant* only they are commonly taken notice
of) but also in *Rue*, *Tab. 43.* *Ground-Ivy*, *Pympernel* or *Anagallis*, and
divers other *Plants*, when held up against the *Light*. The original
whereof seems to be, at least in some, from the *Globulets* above mentioned;
that is, when they break and dry away. So the *Spots* of *Rue-Leaves*,
which in the *Refection* of *Light* look *black*, but upon the *Trajection*
thereof are *transparent*; are so many little *Holes*, pounced half way
through the thickness of the *Leaf*, and seem as made, by the breaking
and drying away of as many *Globulets*. Whence also, as the *Globulets*
are best seen in the younger *Leaves*, so these *Spots* in the elder.

5. §. BESIDES these, and some others (as those in *Ladies-Thistle*)
which are Natural to the *Leaf*; there are also some *Spots*, or
rather *Streaks*, which are *Adventitious*; as those in the *Leaves* of *Sonchus*.
*Tab. 43.* The Cause whereof, is a small flat *Insect*, of a grey *Colour*, and
about ⅙ᵗʰ of an Inch long. Which neither ranging in bredth, nor
striking deep into the *Leaf*; eats so much only as lies just before it,
and so runs scudding along betwixt the *Skin* and the *Pulp* of the *Leaf*;
leaving a whitish *Streak* behind it, where the *Skin* is now loose, as the
measure of its Voyage.

6. §. THE Original and several kinds of *Thorns*, I have describ’d
in the above said *Appendix*. I only add, that the very *Leaves* of some
*Plants*, if they stand till the second year, are changed into so many
*Thorns*, as in the *Furz*.

7. §. They are of Use, not only for the *Protection* of the *Bud*; but
likewise, for the support of the *Plant*; as is observable in those *Climbers*,
which are neither strong enough to stand of themselves; nor yet, from
their fragility, are capable of winding about another, without being
torn all to pieces. For which end also, these *Thorns* grow not like
*Buds*, erected; but poynt all downwards, like so many *Tenters* or
*Hanging-hooks*: as in the *Bramble*, chiefly on the *Stalks*; and in *Clivers*, *Tab. 43.*
also on the *Leaves* themselves; whereby they catch at any Thing that
stands next them; and so, although such slim and feeble *Plants*, yet
easily climb to a very great hight.

8. §. OF THE several *Figures* of *Hairs*,
 and their Use, *B. 1. Ch. 4.* I have
also spoken. As to one Use, *sc.* the *Protection* they give to the *Leaf*,
 *Tab. 43.*
I shall here further note, That the design of *Nature*, is the more evident
if we consider, That all *Leaves* are not alike *Hairy*, nor at all
times, nor in every part: but differently, according to their *Age*, *Substance*,
*Texture*, and *Foulding* up. Their *Age*; for there are many
young *Buds* covered with a thick warm *Hair*, which afterwards dries
up and disappears, as useless; as those of the *Vine*, *Golden Liverwort*,
&c. Their *Substance*; so those *Buds* which are tenderest, and would
sooner feel the cold, if naked, have the fullest *Hair*; as of *Thistle*,
*Mullen*, *Burdock*, and others. Their *Structure*; therefore those *Leaves*,
whose *Fibres* stand more prominent or above their *Surface*, lest the
cold should nip them, are covered with greater Store of *Hair*; as in
*Moth-Mullen*, *Garden-Clary*, and the like. And their *Fould*; it being
observable, That those *Leaves* which are folded up inward, have little
or no *Hair* on their inner, but only on their Back-Sides, which are
open to the *Aer*; as is visible in *Corin*, *Warden*, *Golden Liverwort*,
and others.

9. §. Add hereto, That where there is Store of *Hair*, Nature is
the less sollicitous for other *Covers*; and where there is not, she is more.
So the *Leaves* of *Beans* and *Peasen*, of *Nettle*, *Plantain*, &c. not being
*Hairy*, have each a *Surfoyl*, or else certain *Hairy Thrums*, to protect
them. And those *Plants* which have neither, are such as have a *Hotter
Juyce*, and so less subject to the impressions of *Cold*, as *Speerwort*, *Scurvygrass*,
*Watercress*, *Fenil*, and most of the *Umbelliferous* Kind.

10. §. *Hair* is of use to preserve young *Buds*, not only, from the
cold *Aer*, but also from too much *Wet*; which, if it were contiguous,
especially in *Winter*, would often rot and destroy them. But being
made to stand off in drops at the ends of the *Hair*, doth not hurt,
but refresh them. Thus doth *Nature* make the meanest Things sometimes
subserve to the best Ends.
