### CHAP. V.

### Of the Use of the Attire.

![O](images/i_drop_o_171.jpg)

F the *Secondary Use* hereof, I have spoken in the
*First* **Book**; *Ch. 5.* and particularly, of the *Globulets* or
small *Particles* within the *Thecæ* of the *Seed-like Attire*,
and upon the *Blades* of the *Florid*, I have conjectur’d,
That they are that *Body* which *Bees* gather
and carry upon their *Thighs*, and is commonly called
their *Bread*. For the *Wax* they carry in little
*Flakes* in their *Chaps*: but the *Bread* is a Kind of *Powder*; yet somewhat
moist, as are the said little *Particles* of the *Attire*.

2. §. But the Primary and chief *Use* of the *Attire* is such, as hath
respect to the *Plant* it self; and so appears to be very great and necessary.
Because, even those *Plants* which have no *Flower* or *Foliature*,
are yet some way or other *Attir’d*; either with the *Seminiform*, or the
*Florid Attire*. So that it seems to perform its service to the *Seed*, as
the *Foliature*, to the *Fruit*.

3. §. In discourse hereof with our Learned *Savilian* Professor Sir
*Thomas Millington*, he told me, he conceived, That the *Attire* doth
serve, as the *Male*, for the *Generation* of the *Seed*.

4. §. I immediately reply’d, That I was of the same Opinion;
and gave him some reasons for it, and answered some *Objections*, which
might oppose them. But withall, in regard every *Plant* is ἀῤῥενόθηλυς
or *Male* and *Female*, that I was also of Opinion, That it serveth for

the *Separation* of some *Parts*, as well as the *Affusion* of others. The sum
therefore of my Thoughts concerning this *Matter*, is as follows.

5. §. And First, it seems, That the *Attire* serves to discharge some
redundant *Part* of the *Sap*, as a *Work* preparatory to the *Generation* of
the *Seed*. In particular, that as the *Foliature* serveth to carry off the *Volatile
Saline Sulphur*: So the *Attire*, to minorate and adjust the *Aereal*; to
the end, the *Seed* may become the more *Oyly*, and its *Principles*, the
better fixed. And therefore the *Foliature* generally hath a much
stronger *Odour*, than the *Attire*: because the *Saline Sulphur* is stronger,
than an *Aerial*, which is too subtile to affect the Sense. Hence also it is,
that the *Colour* of the *Parts* of the *Attire*, is usually *White*, or *Yellow*, never
*Red*: the former, depending upon a greater participation of *Aer*;
the latter, of *Sulphur*. I add further, That the most *Volatile* and *Aerial
Sulphur*; being by means of these *Parts* much discharged; it may
hereby come to pass, not only that the *Seed* is more *Oylie*, and its *Principles*
more fixed; but also, that the *Body* or *Parenchyma* thereof, is so
compact and close: For although it consists of *Bladders*, yet such, as
are Twenty times smaller than in any other *Part* of a *Plant* of the like
bigness. Whereas, were the *Aer* copiously mixed with the *Sap* here,
as in the *Pith*, *Fruit*, and other *Parenchymous Parts*; it would give so
quick a *Ferment* to the *Sap*, as to dilate and amplify the *Bladders* of
the *Seed*, beyond its present compact and durable *Texture*; and so expose
it, either to a precipitant *Growth*, or sudden *Rot*. Wherefore, as
the *Seed-Case* is the *Womb*; so the *Attire* (which always stands upon
or round about it) and those *Parts* of the *Sap* hereinto discharged;
are, as it were, the *Menses* or *Flowers*, by which the *Sap* in the *Womb*,
is duly qualified, for the approaching *Generation* of the *Seed*.

6. §. And as the young and early *Attire* before it opens, answers
to the *Menses* in the *Female*: so is it probable, that afterward when it
opens or cracks, it performs the *Office* of the *Male*. This is hinted from
the *Shape* of the *Parts*. For in the *Florid Attire*, the *Blade* doth not
unaptly resemble a small *Penis*, with the *Sheath* upon it, as its *Præputium*.
And in the *Seed-like Attire*, the several *Thecæ*, are like so many
little *Testicles*. And the *Globulets* and other small *Particles* upon the
*Blade* or *Penis*, and in the *Thecæ*, are as the *Vegetable Sperme*. Which,
so soon as the *Penis* is exerted, or the *Testicles* come to break, falls
down upon the *Seed-Case* or *Womb*, and so Touches it with a *Prolifick*
Virtue.

7. §. *Consentaneous* hereto it is also observable, That those *Herbs*
generally have the *Seed-like Attire*, which either produce a greater Quantity
of *Seed*, or a *Perennial Root*: and that there is no *Tree*, with the
*Florid Attire*. As if the other, because it contains a far greater Proportion
of the abovesaid *Particles*, that is, of *Sperm*; ’tis able to beget
a more *Numerous*, *Vivaceous*, or *Gigantick Birth*.

8. §. That the same *Plant* is both *Male* and *Female*, may the rather
be believed, in that *Snails*, and some other *Animals*, are such.
And the *Parts* which imitate the *Menses*, and the *Sperm*, are not precisely
the same: the former, being the External *Parts* of the *Attire*, and
the *Sap*, which feeds them; the latter, the small *Particles* or moyst
*Powder* which the External inclose.

9. §. And that these *Particles*, only by falling on the *Uterus*,
should communicate to it or to the *Sap* therein, a *Prolifick Virtue*; it
may seem the more credible, from the manner wherein *Coition* is made
by some *Animals*; as by many *Birds*, where there is no *Intromission*,
but only an *Adosculation* of *Parts*: And so in many *Fishes*. Neither
in others, doth the *Penis* ever enter any further than the *Neck* of the
*Womb*. Nor doth perhaps the *Semen* it self: or if it doth, it can by no
means be thought, bodily or as to its gross *Substance*, to enter the *Membranes*,
in which every *Conception*, or the *Liquor* intended for it, before
any *Coition*, is involved; but only some subtle and *vivisick Effluvia*,
to which the visible *Body* of the *Semen*, is but a *Vehicle*. And the
like *Effluvia* may be very easily transfused from the above said *Particles*
into the *Seed-Case* or *Womb* of a *Plant*.

10. §. If any one shall require the Similitude to hold in every
Thing; he would not have a *Plant* to resemble, but to be, an *Animal*.
