## Book 4 - Dedication

To the Honourable

Robert Boyle Esq;

SIR,

![A](images/i_drop_a_143.jpg)
*FTER
I had finished the foregoing*
Books, *In which, I conceive, as far as*
Glasses *will yet lead us, I have clearly Describ’d
and Delineated the* Structure *of a*
Plant; *and have endeavour’d, in some
part, to Unfold the* Reason *and* Scope *of* Nature *therein:
I was willing to sit down, and leave what remained,
to the* Improvements *of the Present and Succeeding*
Ages.

*But in Discourse upon this Subject,* You *have been pleased
frequently to insist, That I should by no means omit, to give
likewise, some Examples of the* Mechanisme *of* Nature *in
all the other* Parts. *The Performance whereof therefore,
next to the* Obedience *I owe to the* Royal Society, *is to
be looked upon, as a Due to the Authority which Your Judgment
hath over me.*

*This I have said, that, if what is herein done, shall prove
acceptable unto* Learned Men; *they may know, To whom they
are once more to give their Thanks: After they have so often
done it, upon (a better score) the Publishing of Your own Excellent
Works. In which, there seems to be a Question, Whether
Your Continual Endeavours, to enlarge the Bounds of*
Natural Knowledge, *or Your Successes therein, have been
the Greater. So that, whereas* Nobility *in some, doth

only serve to lift them, like* Jupiter’s Satellits, *out of
sight:* You, *by giving a greater Light, have drawn all
Mens Eyes upon* You. *And whilest there are many, in
all* Ages, *fond of Preheminency in the Conduct of* Popular
Affairs; *who yet rarely hit the Mark they aim at; or
aim at That they pretend:* You *have thought fit, rather
to separate* Your Self, *to that more Innocent, and more
Noble Sort of* Wisdom, *which lieth, not in the* Arts *of*
Conceiling, *but in* Discovering, *the Truth of Things.*

*That we may have many to imitate* You *herein, cannot
but be heartily wish’d by all, who regard the Honour
of their own Country; as it is, with much Zeal, by*

Sir,

Your most obedient

Servant

*NEHEMJAH GREW*.
