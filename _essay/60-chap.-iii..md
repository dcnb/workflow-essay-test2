### Of the several COVERS of Seeds, and of the VITELLUM.

HE
next step of *Natures Managery*, relates chiefly
to the Growth of the *Seed* when it is sow’n. For
which purpose, the outer *Covers* are somewhere
furnished with *Apertures* sufficient for the reception
of *Alimental Moysture* from the *Ground*; and
*Divisions*, for the *shooting forth* of the young
*Root* into it. As in the *Seed* of a *Gourd*, at the
*Bottom*; in a *Bean*, on the *Side*; and in a *Chestnut*,
at the *Top*: *Tab. 72.* in which places the *Radicle* or young *Root* always
lies and puts forth, in the said several *Seeds*. And the *Seed* of *Palma
Christi*; *Tab. 72.* which falls to the Ground not only in the usual *Covers*, but
also in the *Seed-Case*, for the more plentiful admission of *Aliment*, hath
a double *Aperture*. Not much unlike to this, is that found sometimes

in larger parcels of *Euphorbium*; for which *Cause*, I suspect it to be the
*Gumm* of a *Plant* of the *Tithymal* kind.

2. §. If the *Cover* of the *Seed* be stony and very hard, it is also
distinguished into several *Pieces*; whereby they easily cleave asunder
without much resistance to the eruption of the *Root*. So the *Shell* of a
*Hazel-nut* easily cleavs on the edg; and the cleft begins best at the
poynt, where the *Root* stands and shoots forth. *Tab. 75.* The *Shell* of some
*Walnuts* cleavs into three *Parts*; and the *Stone* of the *Bellerick Myrobalan*
into five: that so, being very thick and hard, if one piece should
not yield, another may not fail to do it. And the *Covers* or *Husks* of
some sorts of *Grain*, as of *Millet*, are only folded or laped one over
another, the better to give way to their tender *Sprouts*.

3. §. Besides the *Kernels* of *Plums* and some other *Fruits*, there
are very many *Seeds*, even of the smaller sort, which have also stony
*Covers*; as of *Carthamum*, *Myagrum monospermon*, *Beet*, *Borage*,
*Lithosperme*, *Amaranthus*, *Violet*, &c. Sometimes, for the reception of
the harsher and less matured *Principles* from the *Seed*, in its *Generation*,
as in *Borage*. Commonly, to keep it warmer before and after its sow’n.
For which purpose, the outer *Covers* of some *Seeds*, are as it were
Lined with *Fur*: in that of *Great Maple*, Short; of *Gossipium*, Long.
And if the *Seed* requires a longer stay under ground, the hardness of
the *Cover* serves to stint the *Aliment*; lest too much, should either rot
it, or cause it to germinate, before its proper season, or full time for a
more *Masculine* Growth.

4. §. On the contrary, many *Seeds*, as those of *Clary*, *Garden-Cress*,
and others of that *Tribe*, have their upper *Covers* faced with a
*Mucilage*: which being easily receptive of any *Moysture* in the Ground,
gradually swells, till it lies like a *Gelly* round about the *Seed*. Either
for a more plentiful supply of *Aliment*; or at least, to soften the
*Covers*, the better to accelerate the Growth of the *Seed*.

5. §. The process of Nature in the several steps of the *Vegetation*
of the *Seed*, hath formerly been explained.⁠[70]

[70]
 *B. 1. Ch. 1.*

6. §. THE COVERS of all, or at least the far greater number
of *Seeds*, are Three; some way or other derived from the *Pith*:
as shall hereafter be seen. And sometimes, Four: even those of ston’d
*Fruits*, have Three, besides the *Stone*. In that of *Gossipium*, there are
Two *Coats* under that lined with the *Cotton*. The *Seeds* of *Cucumer*,
*Goats-beard*, *Broom*, *Scabious*, *Lettice*, &c. although so small, have
plainly Three *Coats*. *Tab. 75.* But in some of these, and many more, there are
only Two distinctly visible, except in the State of *Generation*.

7. §. In the Upper *Coat*, the *Seed-Vessels* are disseminated. The
Second, is first a meer *Pulp*; but afterwards shrinks up and sticks close
to the upper. The Third or Inmost is more dense; and if it be thin,
for the most part, transparent; whereby the *Seed* seems sometimes to
be naked while it lies therein; as in *Almonds*, *Cucumers*, and the like. *Tab. 76.*
For this sticks not to the midle *Coat*, as that doth to the outer; but
commonly, remains entire, after those are stripp’d off, being as it were,
the *Smock* of the *Seed*.

8. §. In *Melissa* and some other small *Seeds*, it comes finely off upon
soaking in warm Water or on the *Tongue*. In *Fenugreek*, ’tis soft,
and of an *Amber-Colour*; and being moystened, looks almost like fine
*Glew*. But commonly, ’tis a pretty tough *Membrane*, and often with

some thickness, as in *Plums*, *Borage*, *Scabious*. Yet always extream
thin at the *Tip* of the *Radicle*; the more easily to break and yield to
it, as the *Secundine* to the *Fœtus*, when it first shoots into the Ground.
And sometimes, as in the *Seeds* of an *Orange*, it hath at one end, the
resemblance of a *Placenta*. *Tab. 75.* But of this, and the two upper *Coats*, I
shall give a further Description in the last *Chapter*.

9. §. AS ALL *Seeds* are *ex Ovo*; so there are many with thin
*Covers*, as of *Orach*, *Spinage*, *Beet*, and the rest of that *Tribe*, &c.
which besides the *Albumen* or clear *Liquor* out of which they are bred;
have also, a *Vitellum*, or a *Body* thereunto *Analogous*: being neither part
of the *Seed*, nor part of the *Covers*, but distinct from them both. With
respect to the *Bulk* of the *Seed*, very large, as white as *Starch*, and pretty
friable, like good *Rice* or *Barley*: *Tab. 75.* of a roundish *Figure*, and grooved
on the *Girth*, so as to have a double *Edge*; Whereby the *Seed*, which
is long and slender, lies round it, as a *Sack* of *Corn* upon a *Pack-Saddle*
or a *Rope* upon a *Pully-wheel*. Upon my first notice hereof, it seemed
to answer to a *Placenta*. But upon further consideration, the *Analogy*
doth not hold betwixt them. For the *Placenta* lies without the *Membranes*
in which the *Fœtus* is conteined: whereas this body lies within
the *Covers* contiguous to the *Seed*, and so becomes its first and finest *Aliment*,
as the *Yelk* doth to the *Chick*. For which purpose, as in the *Generation*
of the *Seed*, it is a pure *Milky Chyle*; So in its *Vegetation*, it is
converted into the like again.

10. §. The same Body for Sustenance is observable in the *Seeds* of
*Rhapontick*, *Dock*, *Sorrel*, and the rest of that kindred, with this difference;
*Tab. 75.* That whereas in *Orach*, &c. the *Seed* only lies upon it; here,
the main *Body* or *Lobes* of the *Seed* are immersed therein, the *Radicle*
standing naked or above it. So that the said *Lobes*, and therein the
*Seminal-Root* are beded herein, as in a *Tub* of *Meal* or a little pot of pure
refin’d *Mould*, necessary for the first *Vegetation* of the *Radicle*.

11. §. BY THESE midle *Steps*, *Nature* proceeds from the
*Thiner Covers* of *Seeds*; or those, which after the *Generation* of the
*Seed* is finished, shrink up; to the *Bulky Kind*, or those which keep
their *Bulk* after they are dry. Wherein, not only the *Lobes*, as in
*Dock*, but the whole *Seed* is immediately lodged. Different in *Substance*,
*Shape* and *Bulk*; but always many times biger than the true *Seed*
within it: for which it is commonly mistaken; but is no more the *Seed*,
than is the *Stone* of a *Plum*, the *Kernel*.

12. §. In the *Barbado Nut*, ’tis *White*, *Soft*, *Conick-oval*, and taking
all its *Dimensions*, 8 or 10 times bigger than the *Seed* within it.
In *Ashen Keys*, ’tis of a sad *Colour*, *hard*, yet somewhat *Oyly*, *Oval* and
*flat*, and of the same *Bigness* as in the *Barbado Nut*, with respect to the
*Seed*. *Tab. 76.* In the *Fruit* commonly called *Nux Vomica Officinarum*, ’tis of
the *Colour* and *Hardness* of a *Cows-Horne*; and makes almost the whole
*Body* of the *Fruit*, being about 14 or 15 times the *Bulk* of the *Seed*.
*Tab. 77.* In *Goosgrass* or *Cliver* ’tis of the like *Horny Substance*, but shaped somewhat
like a *Bonet* with the *Rimm* tuckt in. And so in a *Coffee-Berry*; but
rowled or foulded up into a kind of *Oval Figure*, with a *Notch* or *Rima*
through the Length, where the two *Ends* meet. With other diversities
which will best be understood, when I come presently to the *Description*
of the *Seed* herein contained.

13. §. With respect to the use of this *Cover*, it is observable, that
where there is a *Stone* or *Shell* over it, as in the *Barbado Nut*, it is
*soft*; but where there is none, as in *Nux Vomica*, *Ash*, &c. ’tis hard;
and so it self instead of a *Stone*. As also, That it becomes *hard*, only
by the proper Nature of its *Parenchyma*, and the exquisite *smallness* of
the *Bladders* of which it consists. Whereas a *Stone*, is also hardened by
the *Lees* or *Tartar* of the *Sap* which sinks into it, and thereby *petrifies* it⁠[71]
as hath been said. So that whereas a *Stone*, as it lies in the *Ground*,
only cleavs in certain Places, but continues hard: This *Cover*, like some
*Horns*, upon the due accession of *Moisture*, doth gradually become
*soft*. Whereby, as while it is *hard*, it performs the Office of a *Stone*,
in guarding the *Seed* til the proper *Season* for its *Growth*: So afterwards
when it is *soft*, it answers, as in *Orach* or *Dock*,⁠[72] to a *Vitellum*,
from whence the *Seed* receiveth its first and purest *Aliment*.
