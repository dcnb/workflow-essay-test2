F
WE take an account of the *Degrees* whereunto
the Knowledge of *Vegetables* is Advanced, it appeareth,
That besides the great Varieties, which
the Successful *Arts* of *Florists*, or Transplantations
from one *Climate* to another, have produced; we
have very many *Species* brought to light, especially
Natives of the *Indies*, which the *Ancients*, for any
thing that appears in their *Writings* now extant, were ignorant of.
In which particular *Clusius*, *Columna*, *Baubinus*, *Boccone*, and others,
have performed much. Withall, That their *Descriptions* (of all Parts
above ground) their *Places* and *Seasons*, are with good diligence and
preciseness set before us. Likewise their Order and Kindred: for the
adjusting whereof our Learned Countryman Mr. *Ray*, and Dr. *Morrison*,
have both taken very laudable pains. As also the ordering of
them with respect to their *Alimental* and *Mechanick* Uses; for which,
amongst others, Mr. *Evelyn* and Dr. *Beal* have deserved many thanks,
and great praise. We are also informed, of the *Natures* and infallible
*Faculties* of *many* of them. Whereunto so many as have assisted, have
much obliged their *Posterity*.

2. §. By due Reflection upon what hath been *Performed*; it also
appears, what is left *Imperfect*, and what *Undone*. For the *Virtues* of
most *Plants*, are with much *uncertainty*, and too *promiscuously* ascribed
to them. So that if you turn over an *Herbal*, you shall find almost
every *Herb*, to be good for every *Disease*. And of the *Virtues* of
many, they are altogether silent. And although, for the finding out,
and just appropriation of them, they have left us some *Rules*, yet not
all. The *Descriptions* likewise of many, are yet to be perfected; especially
as to their Roots. Those who are very curious about the
other *Parts*, being yet here too remiss. And as for their *Figures*, it
were much to be wished, That they were all drawn by one *Scale*; or,
at most, by Two; one, for *Trees* and *Shrubs*; and another for *Herbs*.
Many likewise of their *Ranks* and *Affinities*, are yet undetermined.
And a great number of *Names*, both *English* and *Latine*, not well given.
So what we call *Goat’s-Rue*, is not at all of kin to that Plant, whose
*Generical Name* it bears. The like may be said of *Wild-Tansy*, *Stock-July-Flowers*,
*Horse-Radish*, and many more. So also when we say
*Bellis Major*, & *Minor*, as we commonly do, these *Names* would intimate,
That the *Plants* to which they are given, differ (as the great
double *Marigold*, doth from the less) only in Bulk: whereas, in truth,
they are two *Species* of *Plants*. So we commonly say, *Centaurium Majus
& Minus*, *Chelidonium Majus & Minus*, and of others in like manner,
which yet are distinct *Species*, and of very different *Tribes*. But for
the *Reason* of *Vegetation*, and the *Causes* of all those infinite *Varieties*
therein observable (I mean so far as *Matter*, and the various *Affections*
hereof, are instrumental thereunto) almost all Men have seemed to
be unconcerned.

3. §. That Nothing hereof remaineth further to be known, is a
Thought not well Calculated. For if we consider how long and gradual
a *Journey* the *Knowledge* of *Nature* is; and how short a Time
we have to proceed therein; as on the one hand, we shall conclude it
our ease and profit, To see how far Others have gone before us: so
shall we beware on the other, That we conceive not unduly of *Nature*,
whilst we have a just value for Those, who were but her *Disciples*,
and instructed by Her. Their Time and Abilities both, being
short to her; which, as She was first Designed by *Divine Wisdom*;
so may Her vast Dimensions best be adjudged of, in being compared
Therewith. It will therefore be our Prudence, not to insist upon
the Invidious Question, Which of Her *Scholars* have taken the fairest
measure of Her; but to be well satisfied, that as yet She hath not
been Circumscribed by Any.

4. §.Nor doth it more behove us to consider, how much of the
Nature of *Vegetation* may lie before us yet *unknown*; Than, to believe,
a great part thereof to be *knowable*. Not concluding from the
acknowledged, much less supposed Insuccessfulnes, of any Mens Undertakings:
but from what may be accounted Possible, as to the Nature
of things themselves; and from *Divine Providence*, by Infinite Ways
conducting to the knowledge of them. Neither can we determine
how great a part This may be: Because, *It is impossible to Measure, what
we See not*. And since we are most likely to under-measure, we shall
hereby but intrench our Endeavours, which we are not wont to carry
beyond the *Idea*, which we have of our *Work*.

5. §. And how far soever this kind of Knowledge may be attainable,
its being so far also worthy our attainment will be granted. For
beholding the Many and Elegant Varieties, wherewith a Field or
Garden is adorned; Who would not say, That it were exceeding pleasant
to know what we Se*e*: and not more delightful, to one who has
*Eyes*, to discern that all is very fine; than to another who hath *Reason*,
to understand *how*. This surely were for a Man to take a True Inventory
of his Goods, and his best way to put a price upon them. Yea
it seems, that this were not only to be *Partaker of Divine Bounty*;
but also, in some degree, *To be Copartner in the Secrets of Divine Art*.
That which were very desireable, unless we should think it impertinent
for us to design the *Knowing* of *That*, which *God* hath once
thought fit to *Do*.

6. §.If for these, and other *Reasons*, an inquiry into the Nature
of *Vegetation* may be of good Import; It will be requisite to see, first
of all, What may offer it self to be enquired of; or to understand,
what our *Scope* is: That so doing, we may take our aim the better in
making, and having made, in applying our Observations thereunto.
Amongst other Inquiries therefore, such as these deserve to be proposed.
First, by what means it is that a *Plant*, or any *Part* of it, comes
to *Grow*, a *Seed* to put forth a *Root* and *Trunk*; and this, all the other
*Parts*, to the *Seed* again; and all these being *formed*, by continual Nutrition
still to be *increased*. How the Aliment by which a *Plant* is
fed, is duly prepared in its several *Parts*; which way it is *conveyed*
unto them; and in what manner it is *assimilated* to their respective Natures
in them all. Whence this Growth and Augmentation, is not
made of one, but many differing Degrees, unto both extremes of *small*
and *great*; whether the comparison be made betwixt several *Plants*, or
the several *Parts* of one. How not only their *Sizes*, but also their
*Shapes* are so exceeding various; as of *Roots*, in being Thick or Slender,
Short or Long, Entire or Parted, Stringed or Ramified, and the
like: of *Trunks*, some being more Entire, others Branched, others
Shrub’d: of *Leaves*, which are Long or Round, Even-edg’d or Escallop’d,
and many other ways different, yet always Flat: and so for
the other *Parts*. Then to inquire, What should be the reason of their
various *Motions*; that the *Root* should *descend*; that its descent should
sometimes be *perpendicular*, sometimes more *level*: That the *Trunk* doth
*ascend*; and that the ascent thereof, as to the space of *Time* wherein
it is made, is of different *measures*: and of divers other *Motions*, as
they are observable in the *Roots*, *Trunks*, and other *Parts* of *Plants*.
Whence again, these *Motions* have their Different, and Stated *Terms*;
that *Plants* have their set and peculiar *Seasons* for their *Spring* or
*Birth*, for their *Full Growth*, and for their *Teeming*; and the like.
Further, what may be the Causes as of the *Seasons* of their *Growth*;
so of the *Periods* of their *Lives*; some being *Annual*, others *Biennial*,
others *Perennial*; some *Perennial* both as to their *Roots* and *Trunks*;
and some as to their *Roots* only. Then, as they pass through these several
*Seasons* of their *Lives*, in what manner their convenient *feeding*,
*housing*, *cloathing* or *protection* otherwise, is contrived; wherein, in this
kind and harmonious *Oeconomy*, one *Part*, may be officious to another,
for the preservation of the health and life of the *whole*. And lastly,
what care is taken, not only for themselves, but for their *Posterity*; in

what manner the *Seed* is prepared, formed and fitted for *Propagation*:
and this being of so great concernment, how sometimes the other *Parts*
also, as *Roots*, in putting forth *Trunks*; *Trunks* in putting forth *Roots*;
yea in turning oftentimes into *Roots* themselves; whereof, in the *Second
Book of the Anatomy of Plants*, I shall give some instances. With
other *Heads* of Inquiry of this kind.

7. §.Nor are the *Natures*, *Faculties*, and *Contents* of *Vegetables*
less various, or a particular Inspection hereinto, of less concernment.
For since All, or Most, seem to grow in the same manner, with one *Sun*,
one *Rain*, indifferently well upon one *Soil*, and, to outward appearance,
to have the same *Common Parts*; it may be asked, *How* it comes to pass
that their *Liquors*, or other *Contained Parts*, are of such different
*Kinds*; one being *Watry*, another *Winy*, a third *Oily*, a fourth *Milky*,
and the like. *How* also there is such a variety in their *Sensible
Qualities*, as their *Colours*, *Tastes*, and *Smells*; what those *Materials*
are, which are necessary to the *Being* of these *Qualities*; and those
*Formalities*, wherein their *Essence* doth consist; as what it is that makes
a *Plant*, or *Flower*, to be *white* or *red*; *fragrant* or *fetid*; *bitter* or *sweet*;
or to be of any other *Colour*, *Smell*, or *Taste*. In like manner, their *Faculties*
and *Powers*, what that is, or those things are, by which they
are constituted; as whence one becomes *Purgative*, another *Vomitory*,
a third *Diaphoretick*, *&c.*, These, I say, with many other particular
Inquiries depending hereupon; as they cannot but much oblige the
Reason of Man to be obsequious to them, so by bringing in, at least,
some satisfaction, will no less reward it. Especially, if it be withal
considered, that besides our satisfaction as to the *Nature* of *Vegetation*;
some further Light, to divers other parts of Knowledge, may likewise
hence arise.

8. § For since the present Design will ingage us, to an accurate
and multifarious Observation of *Plants*; we may hereby be enabled
to *range* and *sort* them with more certainty, according to the Degrees
of their *Affinity*. And all *Exoticks*, *Plants* or *Parts* of *Plants*, may
probably be reduced to some such *Domesticks*, unto which they may
bear the best Resemblance. Again, it may frequently conduct our
minds to the consideration of the *State* of *Animals*; as whether there
are not divers material Agreements betwixt them both; and what
they are. *Wherein* also they may considerably differ, and what those
things are which are more essential to their distinguishment. And *besides*,
not only to compare what is already known of both; but also,
by what may be observed in the *one*, to suggest and facilitate the finding
out of what may yet be unobserved in the *other*. So *also* the consideration
of the *Colours*, *Smells*, and *Tastes* of *Vegetables*, may conduce to
the Knowledge of the same *Qualities* in General; or of what it is, that
constitutes them such, in any other Body: not as they are *actually* received
by *Sense*; but so far, as such *Materials* or external *Circumstances*,
are requisite to their becoming the *Adequate Objects* thereof. *It
may* lead us also to inquire into further Ways of *Cultivation*, with respect
to the whole *Plant*, or to the *Flower*, *Fruit*, or other *Part*:
To amend them as to their *Sizes*, *Colours*, *Tastes*, *Fruitfulness*, or otherwise:
To think of other Ways of *Propagation*; or to apply those already
known to other *Plants* than hath been used. Likewise the Knowledge
of their *Mechanical* Uses may hereby be enlarged; both as to the

Reason of their use, in such particular *Trades* and *Manufactures*, already
known; and the discovery of other uses yet unknown. As also
their *Alimental*, with respect both to *Meats* and *Drinks*; the preparation
of some, and the finding out of others. But especially their *Medicinal*;
some *Plants* which have hitherto been neglected, may be applied
to use; the *Perverted* uses of some, and the *Confused* uses of
others, may be rectified. What may best correct their *Malignancies*,
or inforce their *Virtues*; When needful to add the preparations of *Art*
to That of *Nature*; How to Enlarge those of *Art*, and Rectifie those
which are indeed Inartificial, may hereby be better conjectured. The
knowledge of all which, that we may know how far it is accessible,
and what probable Approaches may be made towards it; those several
Means I have thought of, and suppose necessary thereunto, are next
to be proposed.

9. §. Reflecting then upon the present Design, and seeing this to
lie wide; we shall, in the first place, conclude the *Means* attending
thereon, should do so likewise. Wherefore, although some may present
themselves unto us as more promising; yet let us suppose what
several Persons, were they hereunto engaged, each according to his
Sense and Genius, would possibly make choice of. Believing, that
although Considering Men may vary, in the approval of their own
Sense and Notion; yet not always mearly, because it is their own;
but because each, may probably see somewhat more in his own, than
others do. Wherefore it will be our surest Logick to conclude, Not
because no *Mean* may be approved by all Men, that all *Means* should
be rejected; but rather, because each may be approved by some, that
therefore, all be made choice of. And these, I think, may be comprehended
under Five General *Heads* of Enquiry. *First*, Of those Things,
which are of more *External* Consideration about *Plants*, as their *Figures*,
*&c.* *Secondly*, Of their Compounding *Parts*, as *Vessels*, *&c.*
*Thirdly*, Of their *Liquors*, and other *Contents*. *Fourthly*, Of their
*Principles*, as *Salts*, *&c.* *Fifthly*, Of their *Aliment*, as *Water*, and other
Means of Growth.

10. §. AND FIRST of all, whatever is of more *External* Consideration, The First General *Mean*.
as the *Figures*, *Proportions*, *Motions*, *Seasons*, *Situations* of
*Vegetables*, and of their several *Parts*, should be observed. In doing
which, a particular survey of all their Varieties should be taken. And
then a Comparison made betwixt these, and the several *Plants*, or *Parts*
of *Plants*, whereof they are the *Properties*. To the end, We may, if
possible, be thereby conducted to find out, what other, either sensible,
or more recluse *Property*, any of them may agree together in. For
it is not more certain, that the three Angles of every *Rectilinear Triangle*,
because all ways equal to two *Right Angles*, are therefore, if put
together, always the same: than that *one Property*, agreeing to divers
*Vegetables*, should have one *Cause*: For although the *Scope* and *End*
may vary; yet the *Cause*, as it is the *Cause* of that *Property*, must be
*one*: and consequently, must also import some *Identity* in the *Nature*
of all those *Vegetables* wherein it Acts. Wherefore by thus comparing
of them, we shall be able more exactly to state the *Orders* and *Degrees*
of their *Affinities*; Better to understand both the *Causes* and *Ends* of
their *Varieties*: And more probably to conjecture of their *Natures* and
*Vertues*.

11. §. First then the various *Figures* of their several *Parts* should
be observed; and that with respect both to the *Forms*, and the *Positions*,
by which their *Roots*, *Trunks*, *Branches*, *Leaves*, *Flowers*, *Fruits*,
and *Seeds* may vary, or agree; and those several *Lines*, by which
both the said *Varieties* are determin’d. In which of these *Parts*, the
agreement chiefly lies; this being both more observable, and more
material in some of them; less in the Root, more in the Flower, or
Seed. And in how many of these *Parts* together; whether one, more,
or all. By both which, the *Orders* and *Degrees* of *Affinity*, which
are many, may be accounted; either as to what we strictly call *Kindred*,
or else *Analogy*. For there are found, not only *Herbs* accounted
of several *Tribes*, which are ally’d; and some of the Smallest, which
are of kin to the Greatest: But there are also, probably, some *Herbs*,
which have a particular Relation, to many Kinds of *Shrubs*; and some
*Shrubs*, to many Kinds of *Trees*. Thus the several sorts of *Letuce*, are
of Kin, together in the *First Degree*; with *Endive*, in the *Second*. The
several *Clarys*, amongst themselves in the *First*; with *Horehound*, in
the *Second*; with *Lamium*, in the *Third*. All *Strawberries* agree together,
in the *First* Degree; with *Cinquefoyl*, in the *Second*; with *Tormentil*
in the *Third*; and with *Avens*, *&c.* in other Degrees more remote.
So *Agrimony*, hath alike Analogy unto *Strawberry*; as *Goats-Rue*,
hath to *Claver*: And *Strawberry*, the like unto the *Rasp*; as *Goosberry*
to the *Vine*; or *Burnet*, to the *Rose*. Amongst the several *Sorts*
of *Grass*, there are some which match all those of *Corn*; which is but a
greater kind of *Grass*. So again all *Pulse*, are not only of kin, in their
several Degrees, to one another; but likewise, to almost all kinds of
*Trefoyls*, as *Melilot*, *Fœnugreek*, and the common *Clavers* themselves;
as by comparing not only their *Leaves*, but *Flowers*, *Seeds*, and *Cods*
together, may be evident. For the several *parts* of the *Flower* of a
*Trefoyl*, are so many more *Flowers*, containing so many *Cods* of small
*Seeds*, all, in shape, agreeable to the *Flowers*, *Cods*, and *Seeds* of *Pulse*.
The same Relation, which *Trefoyls* have to the *Peas* or other *Pulse*;
*Colts-foot*, hath to *Buttyr-Bur*; *Chickweed* to *Leucanthemum*; *Groundsell*,
to *Jacobæa*; or *Scorodonia*, to *Foxglove*: Or, to go higher, as the
*Leguminous* Kinds of *Herbs*, have to *Sena*, or some other of the *Lobed
Shrubs* and *Trees*. And, as among *Animals*, there are some which connect
several Kinds; as the *Batt* doth *Beasts* and *Birds*: So, among
*Plants*, there are some also, which seem to stand between two *Tribes*;
as *Lappa*, between *Knapweeds* and *Thistles*; *Lampsana*, between the
*Intybaceous* Kind, and the *Mouse-ears*.

12. §. From hence likewise, the *Natures* of *Plants* may be conjectured.
For in looking upon divers *Plants*, though of different
*Names* and *Kinds*; yet if some affinity may be found betwixt them,
then the *Nature* of any one of them being well known, we have thence
ground of conjecture, as to the *Nature* of all the rest. So that as every
*Plant* may have somewhat of *Nature individual* to it self; so, as far
as it obtaineth any *Visible Communities* with other *Plants*, so far, may
it partake of *Common Nature* with those also. Thus the *Wild*, and
*Garden Cucumers*, have this difference; that the one *purgeth* strongly,
the other, *not at all*: yet in being *Diuretick*, they both agree. The
*Natures* of *Umbelliferous Plants*, we know, are various; yet ’tis most
probable, that they all agree in this one, *scil.* in being *Carminative*.

The several sorts, both of *Corn* and *Grass*, are all akin; there is no
doubt therefore, but that the *Seeds* of *Grass* themselves (of *Rye* and
*Oats* it is tryed) if it were worth the while to order them, as *Barley*,
would yield an inflammable Spirit. So likewise the several Kinds of
*Pulse*, have some one community in their Form, as is said: for which
reason, I question not, but that in some Cases, wherein *Cicers* are esteemed
a good *Medicine*; a *Decoction* of the better sort of *Pease*, especially
that we call the *Sugar-Pease*, may go beyond them. As doth also
the *Flower* or *Meal* of *Beans*, that of the *Seeds* of *Fœnugreek*; even
there, where they are accounted excellent. So *Tulips*, *Lillies*, *Crocuses*,
*Jacynths*, and *Onions* themselves, with many others, in their several
Degrees, are all *allied*. If therefore *Crocuses*, *Onions*, *Lillies*, agree
in one or more *Faculties*, then why may not all the rest? as in being
*Anodyne*; or in some other *Common Nature*; whereby, in their *Vegetation*,
their *Parts* are Governed and Over-ruled, to one Common or
*Analogous Form*.

13. §. The *Proportions* likewise, amongst the several *Parts* of *Vegetables*,
for the same Reasons, deserve to be observed; the comparison
being made, both betwixt the *Parts* of several *Plants*, and the several
*Parts* of one. And here again, either betwixt any Two of the
*Parts*, or any One of them, and the Whole besides, or all the rest
put together. So some larger *Seeds*, produce a small *Root*; as those
of *Cucumer*: and others smaller, produce one very great; as those of
*Bryony*. Some *Plants*, as the *Melon*, though themselves but very slender,
yet have a vast and bulky *Fruit*; others again, as *Thistles*, and
many yet more substantial, have no other *Fruit*, besides their *Seed*.
So the *Seeds* of all *Pulse*, and especially, the *Garden Bean*, though
large, yet produce but a small *Plant*: but those of *Foxglove*, *Mullen*,
*Burdock*, *Sun-flower*, *&c.* being themselves much less, do yet produce
a far greater. And especially, those *Seeds*, which are inclosed in the
Thicker sort of *Cover*, (analogous to that I have elsewhere called
the *Secondine*) as that of *Peony*; Anat. Plant. Book I. Chap. ult.whose *Seed*, so called, is only the
*Nest* wherein the true and real *Seed* is lodged, no bigger than a little
Pins head: which is also observable of the *Seeds* of divers other
*Plants*. These, and the like *Proportions*, as they lie betwixt the several
*Parts*, should be noted: and to what *Plants* or *Parts* especially, any
of them may agree: comparing also in what other kind of *Properties*
an agreement betwixt the said *Parts* may be found: that so doing, we
may, if possible, amongst all their *Individual Natures*, be instructed to
single out those *Common Ones*, which are concomitant to such Agreeing
*Properties*.

14. §. The several *Seasons* also of *Plants*, and of their *Parts*, should
be considered. Observing at what particular Times of the Year, any
of them chiefly *Spring*, Early or Late. The Times wherein they *Germinate*;
whether for some Space only, or all the Year long. Wherein
they *Spring*, after Sowing; or *Flower*, after Springing, sooner, or
slower. Which Flower, the *first* Year, or not till the *second*. Which
*after* the *Leaves* are put forth, or *before* them; for so, some do, as
the *Crocus Vernus*, *Bears-foot*, *Hepatica aurea*, and others; all the *Leaves*,
at the time of their flowering, being old, or of the foregoing Year’s
growth. So likewise the *Maturation* of the *Fruit* or *Seed*; how long
after the *Flower*, and the like. All or some of which *Varieties*, being

laid together, we may probably conjecture the *Causes* thereof, and
the *Natures* of the *Plants* in which they are seen: *scil.* as such a Degree
of Heat may be necessary for the Fermentation, or the better Distribution
of the *Sap* of such a *Plant*; or for the Impregnation of
the *Aer*, to be mixed therewith; or the due Disposing of the *Soil*, to
render the most convenient Aliment thereunto. So the *Principles* of
such *Plants*, which flower all the Year, may be more equally proportion’d.
Those which flower before the *Leaves* put forth, as the *Crocus
Vernus*, and those which flower in *Spring*, may be accounted *Rank*,
and full of *Volatile Salt*. But *Autumn Plants* especially, to abound with
a Fixed: and the like.

15. §. The proper *Places* also of *Plants*, or such wherein they
have, from their *Seeds*, or other way of *Propagation*, a Spontaneous
growth, should be considered. And that as to the *Climate*; whether
in one Colder, Temperate, or more Hot. The *Region*; Continent,
or Island. The *Seat*; as Sea, or Land, Watry, Boggy, or Dry; Hills,
Plains, or Vallies; Open, in Woods, or under Hedges; Against *Walls*,
rooted in them, or on their Tops: and the like. And perhaps the
*Seeds* of some *Plants*, as of *Mosses*, (which, through their smallness,
will ascend like Moths in the Sun) may fly or swim for some time, in
the Aer, *viz.* till they begin to shoot, and so become heavy enough,
to fall down upon the Ground. From whence, in like manner, as
from their *Seasons*, their particular *Natures* may be directed unto.
In that, so far as we may conjecture the nature of such an *Aer*, *Soil*, or
*Seat*, we may also of such a *Plant*, to which they are *congenial*.

16. §. So likewise, those many Varieties observable in the *Motions*
of *Plants*, and of their Parts, both Kinds and Degrees; *Ascending*,
*Descending*, and *Horizontal*; *Rectilinear*, and *Spiral Motions*, should be
noted; to what *Plants* they agree, and wherein any of these Motions
may be analogous to those of *Animals*. And in a word, any other
*Forensick Properties* of *Plants*. And then, to Compare them all together;
both being necessary. For *Thoughts* cannot work upon nothing,
no more than *Hands*. He that will build an House, must provide
Materials. And on the contrary, the Materials will never become
an House, unless, by certain Rules, we joyn them all together.
So, it is not, *simply*, the Knowledge of *many things*, but a multifarious
Copulation of them in the Mind, that becomes prolifick of further
Knowledge. And thus much for the first General *Mean*.

17. §. THE NEXT which I propose, and that a most necessary
one, is *Anatomy*. The Second General *Mean*.
For when upon the Dissection of *Vegetables*, we
see so great a difference in them, that not only their Outward *Figures*,
but also their Inward *Structure*, is so Elegant; and in all, so
Various; it must needs lead us thus to Think, That these Inward
*Varieties*, were either to no *End*; or if they were, we must assign to
what. To imagine the first, were exceeding vain; as if *Nature*, the
Handmaid of *Divine Wisdom*, should with Her fine *Needle* and *Thred*,
stitch up so many several *Pieces*, of so difficult, and yet so groundless
a Work. But if for some *End*, then either only to be looked upon,
or some other besides. If for this only, then this must be such as in
respect whereof, Her Work is at no time, nor in any degree frustrate;
the contrary whereunto, is most manifest. For although Men do
every where, with frequent pleasure, behold the Outward Elegancies of

*Plants*; yet the Inward Ones, which, generally, are as Precise and
Various as the Outward; we see, how usual it is, for the beholding of
These, to be omitted by them. And besides, when we have observed
*Nature’s* Work, as well as we can; it may be no impediment to our
best Endeavours, to believe, That some Parts of it, will still remain
behind, *Unseen*. So that if to be *Seen*, were the only End of it, it must
needs be wholly frustrate, as to the greater number of Men; and, in
some part, as to all. Wherefore, we must suppose some other *Ends*
of the said Varieties, which should have their *Effect*, and so These,
not be in vain, whether Men beheld them or not; which, are, therefore,
such as have respect to *Vegetation*: That the *Corn* might grow,
*so*; and the *Flower*, *so*, whether or no Men had a mind, leisure, or ability,
to understand *how*.

18. §. If then the *Anatomy* of *Vegetables* be so useful a *Mean*, we
ought not to streighten it; but to force this, as well as the rest, to its
utmost Extent. And therefore, first of all, To go through all the
*Parts*, with equal care; examining the *Root*, *Trunk*, *Branch*, *Leaf*,
*Flower*, *Fruit*, and *Seed*. Then to Repeat or Retrograde the Dissection,
from *Part* to *Part*: in that, although the best Method of Delivery,
for clear Discourse, can be but one, according to that of *Nature*,
from the *Seed* forward, to the *Seed*: yet can it not but be useful,
for That of Dissection, to proceed *to* and *fro*; somewhat or other
being more Visible in each several *Part*, from whence still an Hint
may be taken, for the ushering in the observation of it in the others.
To examine, again, not only all the *Parts*,but *Kinds* of *Vegetables*, and
comparatively, to observe divers of the same *size*, *shape*, *motion*, *age*,
*sap*, *quality*, *power*, or any other way the *same*, which may also agree,
in some one or more particulars, as to their *Interiour Structure*: and to
make this comparison, throughout all their *Parts* and *Properties*. To
observe them likewise, in several *Seasons* of the Year, and in several
*Ages* of the *Plants*, and of their *Parts*; in both which, divers of them
may be noted to change, not only their *Dimensions*, but their *Natures*
also; as *Vessels*, do into *Ligaments*; and *Cartilages*, into *Bones*, sometimes,
in *Animals*. And to do all this by several Ways of *Section*,
Oblique, Perpendicular, and Transverse; all three being requisite, if
not to Observe, yet the better to Comprehend, some Things. And
it will be convenient sometimes to Break, Tear, or otherwise Divide,
without a *Section*. Together with the *Knife* it will be necessary to
joyn the *Microscope*; and to examine all the *Parts*, and every Way, in
the use of That. As also, that both Immediate, and Microscopical
Inspections, be Compared: since it is certain, That some things, may
be demonstrated by Reason and the Eye conjunct, without a Glass,
which cannot be discovered by it; or else the discovery is so dark, as
which, alone, may not be safely depended on.

19. §. By these several Ways of Inspection, it will be requisite, To
observe their Compounding *Parts*; as *Simply* considered, and as variously
*Proportioned*, and *Disposed*. As *Simply* considered, to note their *Number*;
what, and whether the same, in all: their *Kinds*, wherein different
in the same, or divers *Vegetables*: their *Original*, in part, or in
whole: *Structure*, as to their *Contexture* and their *Cavities*; Their
*Contexture*, within themselves severally, and as joyned together: their
*Cavities*, as to their *Size*, *Shape*, and *Number*; in which a great variety

will be found. Next their *Positions* one amongst another, which
are also various; as Anterior, Posterior, Collateral, Surrounding, Mediate,
Immediate, Near, Remote; both as they respect the several
*Parts*, and the several portions of one: And all these, as few, or more;
these or others of them, may be diversely Compounded together. And
then the *Proportions* they bear one to another; whether as to Minority,
Equality, or Excess; each *Part* compared with each, and that
as to the several Degrees appearing in the said *Proportions*; the Varieties
whereof may be exceeding numerous. For if we should suppose
but *Four* considerable *Parts* generally constitutive of a *Vegetable*:
These *Four*, produce a Variety *Four* ways. First, when One is Unequal;
and then it produceth only *Four* Varieties: and those two ways,
*scil.* when one is Greater, and the other three, Equal and Less; or
when one is Less; and the other three, Equal and Greater. Secondly,
when Two be Unequal; and then they produce *Six* Varieties. Thirdly,
when Three be Unequal, which produceth *Twelve* Varieties. Or
lastly, when all Four be Unequal; which produceth *Twenty four*:
which general Varieties, may be further multiplied by their several
Degrees.

20. §. From all which, we may come to know, what the *Communities*
of *Vegetables* are, as belonging to all; what their *Distinctions*,
to such a Kind; their *Properties*, to such a Species; and their *Peculiarities*,
to such Particular ones. And as in *Metaphysical*, or other
Contemplative Matters, when we have a distinct knowledge of the
*Communities* and *Differences* of Things, we may then be able to give
their true *Definitions*: so may we possibly, here attain, to do likewise:
not only to know, That every *Plant* Inwardly differs from another,
but also wherein; so as not more surely to Define by the Outward
*Figure*, than by the Inward *Structure*, What that is, or those
things are, whereby any *Plant*, or Sort of *Plants*, may be distinguished
from all others. And having obtained a knowledge of the *Communities*
and *Differences* amongst the *Parts* of *Vegetables*; it may conduct
us through a *Series* of more facile and probable *Conclusions*, of the
ways of their *Causality*, as to the *Communities* and *Differences* of *Vegetation*.
And thus much for the Second General *Mean*.

21. §. HAVING THUS far examined the *Organical* and *Containing
Parts* of *Vegetables*; The Third General *Mean*. it will be requisite, more designedly,
to observe those also which are *Fluid*, or any others Contained in
them: and that, for our better understanding both of the *Nature* of
*Vegetation*, and of the said *Contained Parts*. And to make inquiry, *First*
of their *Kinds*; as *Spirits*; both such as agree, in general, in being
*Vinous*; and those that are Special, to particular *Plants*. *Aers* and
*Vapours*; for the existence whereof, in all *Vegetables*, there are Arguments
certainly concluding. And for the difference of their *Natures*,
in being more dry, or moist, more simple or compounded, as
they are existent in several *Parts*, there are probable ones. *Lympha’s*
or clear and watry *Saps*; which most *Plants*, in one *Part* or other,
at some time of the Year, do *Bleed Mucilages*; as in *Mallow* and *Violet
Leaves*; in many *Seeds*, as of *Quinces*, *Clary*; *Fruits*, as in *Cucumers*;
distinct from the watry *Sap*, as by permitting it to stand and
gelly upon the *Vessels* from whence it issues, is plain: And in the
young *Berrys* of White *Bryony*, when about the bigness of a *Pepper-Corn*;

the juyce whereof is so Viscous, that the twentieth part of a
*Grain*, will draw out above a *Yard* in length. *Oyles*; not only in
*Seeds*, and some *Fruits*, but other *Parts*; as in certain little cavities in
the *Leaves* of *Savine*, visibly collected while they are growing. *Gumms*
or *Resines*; as in *Pine*, *Fir*, and others of this Kind. *Milks*; as
in a vast number of *Plants*, and amongst them, many not suspected to
yield any. For, of *Herbs*, not only most of the *Umbelliferous Kind*,
are *Milky*; but all or most of the *Intybous*; *Poppys*; *Tracheliums*;
*Perwinkles*; divers *Thistles*; and even *Onions*, if cut at the bottome;
with a great many more. Of *Trees*, not only the Little *Maple*, but
the young *Shoots* of *Lawrel*, especially being crushed; as also those of
*Elder*, and some others. To which may be added, such *Mucilages*,
which though not so properly contained *within* the *Parts*, yet are
found lying *over* them; as over the first *Spring-leaves* of all kinds of
*Docks*; betwixt the *Leaves* and the *Veil* wherein they are involved.
That fine white Flower or Powder, which lies over the *Leaves* of some
*Plants*, as of *Bears-Ear*: And in *Princes-Feather*, about certain *Apertures*
only on the edges of the *Leaves*.

22. §. Of all these should be observed, *first* their *Receptacles*;
some of them, being proper to one; others, common to two or more
of them: since it is certain, that some of them do Transmigrate from
one, into another *Receptacle*, or that the same *Receptacle* is filled with
Fluid Bodies, of a quite different Nature, at the different *Seasons* of
the *Year*, and *Ages* of the *Vegetable*. And it is also very probable, That
two of some of them, may, sometimes, be contained in one *Receptacle*,
at the same time; as in *Animals*, the *Lympha* in the D. *Thoracicus*, and
that, and the *Chyle*, in the *Sanguineous Vessels*.

23. §. Then their *Motions*; both *Natural*, and such as may be
effected by *Art*: and those either by Descent or Ascent; And in
ascending, through what different *Chanels* or *Parts* of the *Trunk*; since
it is certain, That there is a variety, both in respect of the *Season*, and
of *Vegetables*. Where it will fall in, To observe the *Tapping* of *Trees*.
As also their *Bleeding*: to what *Trees* it is proper to *bleed*: in those to
which it is, with what difference of *Celerity*: and when their peculiar
*Season*: for none will bleed at all times; neither will all *bleed* at the
same. And then their Collateral *Motion*, together with the Mode of
their Transition from one *Organical Part* to another.

24. §. Next their *Quantities*, either of *one*; as the Comparison
is made betwixt several *Plants*, or betwixt the *Parts* of the same. So
the true *Seed* of all *Plants*, containeth more *Oyl*, in proportion, than
any of the other *Parts*. Or else of *divers*, as coexistent and bearing such
a proportion one to another in the same *Part*: of most of which, it
may be known by their respective *Receptacles*. Yet the Computation
must not be made from the number of the said *Receptacles*, *simply*;
but as that is in conjunction with their *Capacity*; and as their *Capacity*
is proportioned to their surrounding *Sides*; the *Sides* of those of the
least *Capacity*, being usually as thick, as those of the greatest: so that
suppose Ten lesser, to lye within the compass of One greater; the *Content*
of these altogether, would scarce be equal to half the *Content* of
that One.

25. §. Also their *Consistence*; *scil.*: of so many of them as are discriminable
by Touch; in being Soft or Hard; Thin or Thick; Mucilaginous,
Gummous, Glutinous, Friable, *&c.* And these in their several
Degrees; in which there is a Variety, as in the *Milks* of some *Plants*, which
are more *Dilute*, than that of others: *Mucilages*; which in some, are
very thick and *Viscous*, in others, more diluted and coming nearer to
a *watry Sap*. And by This, to be compared in the same manner, as
by their *Quantity*.

26. §. Likewise their *Colours*, *Smells*, and *Tastes*: The general
and particular Kinds of all which should be noted. And to what *Contained
Parts*, and in what Variety, they appertain. So most *Resinous
Gumms* are Tinctur’d, some, not; as that which drops from the *Domestick
Pine*, is as clear as Rock-water. The *Milks* of some *Plants* are
*Paler*, as in *Burdock*; of others *Whiter*, as in *Dandelyon*, *Scorzonera*;
*Citrine*, in the Root of *Trachelium*, *Angelica*; *Yellow*, as in *Lovage*. In
some *Plants*, *Odorous*, as in *Umbelliferous*; in others not, as in *Cichoraceous*.
That of Little *Maple*, *Tasteless*; of Garden *Chervil*, *Sweet*; of
*Fenil*, *Hot*; of *Scorzonera*, *Astringent*; of *Dandelion*, *Bitter*; and generally,
in other *Plants*; but with many Degrees of Strength, and in
conjunction with other *Tasts*. But most *Mucilages*, have little either
*Colour*, *Taste*, or *Smell*; and the like. Here also the same *Qualities* are
to be inquired into, as, in general speaking, they are said to belong to
a *Vegetable*. Since it is more than probable, that all *Colours* (excepting
*White*, which is sometimes common both to *Containing* and *Contained
Parts*) all *Odours*, and *Tastes*, which are more immediately, and without
a resolution of their *Essential Principles*, perceptible in a *Plant*; are
not ascribable either to the *Organical*, or *Containing Parts*; but only
to Those, Contained in them; as from divers reasons hereafter may
appear.

27. §. And *first*, their *Colours*; where, with respect to several
*Plants* and *Parts*, they are more *Changeable*; as Red, in *Flowers*; or
*Constant*, as Green, in *Leaves*. Which, with respect to several Ages
of one *Part*, are more *fading*, as Green in *Fruits*; or *durable*, as Yellow
in *Flowers*. In what *Parts* more *Single*, as always in the *Seed*;
or more *Compounded*, as in the *Flower*; and in what *Plants* more especially,
as in *Pancy*. Which proper to *Plants* that have such a *Taste*
or *Smell*, as both, in *White Flowers*, are usually less strong. To *Plants*
that flower in such a *Season*, as a *Yellow Flower*, I think, chiefly, to
*Spring Plants*. And to *Plants* that are natural to such a *Soil* or *Seat*,
as to *Water-plants*, more usually, a *white Flower*. What, amongst all
*Colours*, more Common to *Plants*, as *Green*; or more Rare, as *Black*. And
what all these Varieties of *Colours* are upon *Cultivation*, but chiefly,
in their natural *Soil*. To observe also with their superficial *Colours*,
those within: so the *Roots* of *Docks*, are *Yellow*; of *Bistort*, *Red*;
of *Avens*, Purple; but of most, White. Where the Inward, and Superficial
*Colours* agree; as in the *Leaves*; or vary, as in the other Parts
frequently. And in what manner they are *Situated*; some universally
spreading, others running only along with the *Vessels*, as in the *Leaves* of
Red *Dock*, and the *Flowers* of *Wood-Sorrel*.

28. §. Next their *Odours*; what may be their principal *Seat*;
whether one or divers *Seats* in the same *Plant*. What the chief *Matter*
out of which they are continually bred. What similitude betwixt

the *Smells* of divers *Vegetables*; as betwixt *Baume*, and a *Limon*; the
Green *Leaves* of *Meadow-sweet*, and the green Rinds of *Walnuts*. Or
betwixt those of *Plants* and *Animals*; as the *Smell* of green and well-grown
*Carduus*, is like to that rank *scent*, *ab aliquorum axillis spiranti*.
Which have a more sensible *Smell*; as most have; and which
have less, as *Corn*. Where the green *Leaf* is the most Fragrant *Part*,
as in *Musk-Cranesbill*; where the *Flower*, as in *Roses*; the *Root*, as in
sweet *Calamus*. Where all the *Parts* have some *Odour*, where some, or
one, only; as in *Scurvy-grass*, only the *Flowers*, unless the *Leaves* are
bruis’d; and in *Arum*, the *Pestil* only; for neither the *Leaf*, nor *Root*
hath any *Smell*, unless cut; but this is strong enough, not much unlike
to *Humane Excrements*.

29. §. But especially their *Tastes*, which it much importeth us
more precisely to distinguish; *First*, by their general *Kinds*; for the
number, even of these, may be computed greater than usually it is. I
remember not, that *Heat* and *Acritude*, with respect to *Taste*, are distinguished;
yet *Arum-Root* is very *Pungent*, without any proper
*Heat*; and *Cloves*, are very *Hot*, without any proper *Pungency*. So
the White *Roots* of *Yarrow*, have a *Taste*, hardly any other way perceptible,
than by causing a gentle *glowing* and *continued Warmth* upon
the Tongue. Also their *Respondencies* one to another; as that of *Zedoary*,
and of the lesser *Cardamoms*, is somewhat like to *Camphire*.
Likewise their *Degrees*; in which there is a great latitude, and may
be extended from *One* to *Ten*, or with easie distinction, from *One* to
*Five*: So the *Root* of *Sorrel*, is Bitter in the *first*; of *Dock*, in the
*second*; of *Dog-Rose*, in the *third*; of *Dandelyon*, in the *fourth*; of *Gentian*,
in the *fifth*: observing them, not only as they vary in several
*Kinds* of *Plants*, but the several *Species* of one, as in *Cichory*, *Hawkweed*,
*Dandelyon*. And then their *Compositions*; for *Tastes* are as truly
*conjunct* in one *Part*, as *Colours*: by which, the latitude is still greater;
In that all Kinds of *Tastes*, in all their Degrees, and in differing Numbers,
may be variously Compounded together: For the most part,
*Two*, as in the *Leaves* of *sharp-pointed Dock*, *Astringent*, and *Sowre*;
in *Sorrel-Roots*, *Astringent* and *Bitter*; and in *Aloes*, *Bitter* and *Sweet*;
the one in the *fifth*, the other, in the *first Degree*; as upon an unprejudiced
tryal may be perceived: and yet more evidently in the *Gall*
of any *Land-Animal*. Sometimes *three*, as in *Agrimony*, *Bitter*, *Rough*,
and *Sowrish* and in *Agarick*, *Bitter*, *Rough*, and *Sweet*. And sometimes,
perhaps more. The Sensible distinctions of all which, may lye almost
as wide, as of *Plants* themselves. Wherefore, although it may be
thought rashness, to take away the distinctions of *Hot*, *Cold*, *Moist*,
*Dry*, *Thin*, *Gross*, and other *Qualities*, in their several Degree, which
the *Ancients* have affixed to particular *Plants*: yet since they have
done it, to many of them, with much uncertainty; and that, withal,
they are, more properly, the *Effects* and *Operations* of *Plants*, than their
*Qualites*; Practical Observation, may therefore approve it useful, to
add these Sensible Ones of various *Tastes*, precisely distinguishing their
*Conjugations* and *Degrees*. Lastly, their several Varieties and Mutations,
with respect to the Subject wherein they reside, should also be
noted. As, of all *Tastes* found in *Plants*, *Bitter* and *Sowr*, are most
common; *Sweet* and *Salt*, most rare. Which latter, is not only perceptible
in some *Sea-Plants*; but upon some others, as upon the fresh

*Leaves* of *Tamarisk*; which being licked while they grow, or when
immediately gathered, are plainly *Saltish*. How they vary with the
*Age* of the *Plant*, or *Part*; as the *Roots* of *Radishes*, growing up to
*Seed*, lose the strength of their *Tast*; so most *Fruits* are first *Sowre*,
then *Sweet*. What proper to the several *Parts* of any one *Plant*; so
the *Leaves* of *Wormwood* are extraordinary *Bitter*; the *Root* scarcely
so at all; of an *Hot*, but quite different *Taste*. What more Common, or
Rare, to any *Part*; so no *Root* that I ever tasted, is *Sowre*. And how
they Alternate in several *Plants*; as the *Root* of *Stock-July-flower* is
biting, not the *Leaves*; on the contrary, the *Leaves* of the *Water-Arsmart*,
are *Biting*; but not the *Root*; and the like. To which we
may add the difference of Time wherein the *Tastes* of *Plants* are perceived;
as those of *Arum*, and *Rape-Crowfoot*, are both *Biting*; but
that of the first, as it is slowly perceived, so it continues long; that of
the other, quickly comes, and quickly goes.

30. §. Amongst the other Adjuncts of the *Contained Parts*, though
not of these only, the *Faculties* of *Vegetables* are to be reputed. For
so the *Rosin* of *Jalap*, which is Purgative, is as truly contained in the
*Organical Parts* of that *Root*, as Blood is in *Veins*: It will be requisite
therefore to make particular observation of these also. And first,
what *Faculties* chiefly may reside in *Plants*, above others: so there is
none of known use in *Salivation*, except by holding in the mouth:
Although we may ask, Why some amongst them, may not (being Taken
inwardly) have a power to evacuate by This, as well as other Violent
ways? Where the *Faculty* is more universally spread over all the
*Parts* of a *Vegetable*, as in *Asarum*. Where belonging chiefly or wholly
to any particular *Parts* or *Part*; as chiefly to the *Root* of *Rhubarb*;
and only to the true and proper *Seed* of *Barbado Nuts*. Whether some
*Faculties*, may be proper to some *Parts* especially. What conjunction
they may have with any sensible *Qualities*. So, many *Purgers*, are not
only *Resinous* and *Gummous*; But also *Mucilaginous*; as *Bryony*, wild
*Cucumer*, *Lapathum Sativum*; and therefore probably *Rhubarb*, when
growing; *Mallows*, *Violets*, *&c.* Such as are Purging and Vomitory,
though some of them have a strong *Taste*, yet the greater part, and of
those, many of the stronger sort, have no *Taste*, or not Great; as
*Senna*, *Jalap*, *Scammony*, *Hellebore*, *Asarum*, and others. Amongst
which, although *Hellebore* hath a very *Durable Taste*, yet is it not very
*High* or *Great*. So also, those that are most sensibly tasted, are, I
think, for the most part, more or less *Bitter*; either simply, as *Colocynthis*;
or *Bitter* and *Astringent*, as *Rhubarb*; or *Bitter* and *Sweet*, as
*Aloe*; or *Bitter*, *Astringent*, and *Sweet*, as *Agarick*. Few are *Hot*, as
*Iris*. Or *simply* Sweet. And though some may be Subacid, that are
Mollifying or Lenitive, yet no proper Purge or Vomit is *Sowre*. Such
*Plants* as are of a soft and sweetish *Taste*, without Viscosity, may be accounted
good *Antiscorbuticks*, especially against the *Sea*, or other *Salt-Scurvey*;
as are good sweet Pease: And sometimes the *Water* or *Spirit*
of the *Shells*; which may easily be drawn from them, being first
duly fermented, and hath a true *Vinous Taste*; but very mild, and not
unpleasant. Those *Plants*, whose Parts are not only *Hot* but *Volatile*,
as *Onions*, are generally good for *Burns*. Such as have a *Balsamick
Taste* or *Smell*, with a little *Astringency*, as *Hypericum*, *Golden-Rod*,
*Lamium Luteum*, *&c.* the best *Wound-Herbs*. And such as are gently

*Bitter*, and *Penetrant* upon the *Tongue*, or in the *Throat*, as *Daisy*, *Anagallis*,
good *Cleansers*. That such *Bodys*, principally, are *Anodyne*, which
are *Yellow*, I think, is more than a conceit; Yelks of Eggs, Fœnugreek
Seeds, Lint-seed Oyl, May-Butyr, Marrow, *Pinguedo Humana*, *Hyoscyamus
luteus*, Safron, Sulphur, Opium, all *Anodyne* and *Yellow*. How
likewise their *Faculties* and *Qualities* may vary their Degrees, either
differently or together: so *Aloe* and *Colocynthis*, are both *Bitter* in the
highest Degree; yet *Aloe*, which is also *Sweet*, Purgeth more moderately;
*Colocynthis*, which is *Bitter*, but not *Sweet*, most Violently. How
far the *Faculties* of *Vegetables*, as well as their *Qualities*, may be Compounded;
where, and which chiefly; as Astrictive and Purgative in
*Rhubarb*. Where this Question may be put, Whether divers other,
and yet more extreme *Faculties*, as well as these of Astrictive and Purgative,
may not somewhere or other be also found, or made, to meet:
whereby the same *Plant*, or some *Preparation* of it, may be most Potent,
and yet most Innocent; the *Malignity* thereof exerting its Power,
and the *Virtue* its Sovereignty at the same time. And lastly, what
*Affinity* there may be betwixt them; as most *Plants*, that are strong
Purgatives, and especially Vomitories, I think, are also *Sternutatory*;
as white *Hellebore*, *Jalap*, *Tobacco*: and on the contrary, such as are
*Sternutatory*, are some of the most proper and most potent *Medicines*
for the Head, Brain, and *Genus Nervosum*, Taken inwardly, as *Lilium
convalle*, *&c.* and the like.

31. §. Thus far a particular observation of the *Qualities* and *Faculties*
of the *Contents* of *Vegetables* may proceed, as they are existent
in their *Natural Estate*. From which, although some probable Conjectures
may be made, of their Material and Formal *Essences*, and of the
*Causes* of their determinate Varieties, or the *Modes* of *Vegetation* necessary
thereunto: yet will our Conceptions hereof be more facile, clear,
and comprehensive, if by all other Ways of Observation, they be likewise
examined, according as *Experiment* maybe applicable to any of
them.

32. §. As by *Contusion*; so some *Plants* give their *Smell*, not without
Rubbing, or not so well; as the green *Leaves* of *Stramonium*, *Scurvygrass*,
and many more: others lose it by Rubbing, as the *flowers* of
*Violets*, *Carnations*, *Borage*, *&c.* others yield it both ways, as *Rosemary*,
*&c.* So some *Apples* mend their *Taste*, by Scoaping, and *Pears*
by Rowling, especially that called the *Rowling Pear*.

33. §. By *Agitation*; which doth that, sometimes, by Force, which
*Digestion*, doth by Heat: so any cold *Oyl* and a *Syrup* being, in a due
manner, agitated together, of two Fluid bodies will become one Consistent,
as is known.

34. §. By *Frigifaction*; how far the *Juyces* of *Plants*, either without
or within them, may be any of them, or some more than others, subject
to *Cold*: and thereby to be deprived of their *Motion* or natural
*Consistence*, or may suffer alteration in their *Colour*, *Taste*, or *Smell*.

35. §. By *Infusion*; where I mean *Infusion* only in Common Water;
So both *Cassia Lignea*, and *Cinnamon* are a little Mucilaginous;
but the former most. Some of the *Contents* of *Plants*, may be wholly
dissolved in Common Water; some but in part, others not at all; or very
little; which is proper to some *Milks*, as well as *Gums*. The *Colours*,
*Smells* or *Tastes* they hereupon yield, are found various; and in

some very unexpected: So the green *Leaves* of *Bawm*, being duly infused
in common Water, without any other Body added, tincture it
with a clear and deep Red, near that of *Claret Wine*, as I have often
tryed.

36. §. By *Subsiding*; So the Juyce of *Sorrel*, being ordered as that
of *Grapes*, will, in time, let fall a kind of *Tartar* or *Essential Salt*. And
so perhaps will that of many other *Plants*, without any previous *Decoction*;
although that be commonly thought to be necessary.

37. §. By *Digestion* with *Fermentation*; either of the entire *Vegetables*,
or of the *Juyces*, or other *Contents*; and these by themselves,
or with common Water. And hereby to note, what difference may
be in the Strength, Celerity, or Continuance of the *Fermentation*. Likewise,
how their *Qualities* may thereby be altered; as the Smell of *Violet-flowers*,
from a most excellent *Fragrancy*, may, by *Digestion*, be reduced
to an odious and abominable *Stink*, like that of the black Mud
of *Gutters*.

38. §. By *Digestion* with *Calefaction*; so the *Colour* of the *Juyce*
of *Limons*, from Transparency (if that be a Colour) may be turned
to a perfect Red. Whence it is that many are deceived in the *Preparation*
called the *Tincture* of *Corals*; supposing the *Corals* to give the
*Menstruum* its Colour. Whereas the *Menstruum* will obtain it, only
by *Digestion*, without any *Corals*, mixed with it.

39. §. By *Decoction*; either of *Vegetables* themselves, or of their
*Liquors*; and to observe what alterations follow. So *Turpentine* boiled
becometh friable, *Sugar*, *Bitter*, and of a Brown Red. *Turneps* lose
their Biting *Taste*; *Onions*, their Picquancy; yet neither of them convey
those self same *Qualities* to the Water. The same may be observed
in the *Decoction* of *Sweet-Fennel-seeds*, *Aniseeds*, and others, losing
much of their *Tastes* themselves, and yet conveying very little of them
to the *Liquors* wherein they are boiled; the greater portion of their
Volatile parts, and so their *Virtue* and *Taste* therewith, flying away.
Whereof therefore it is much better to make an *Emulsion*, than to *decoct*
them; or to make an *Emulsion* from them, with their own *Decoction*,
especially if the *Medicine* be intended to be *Carminative*, as I have frequently
observed. The *Decoction* should also be carried on throughout
all degrees to that of an *Extract*; by which the *Qualities* thereof,
sometimes, are much altered; as the *Colour* of all or most green *Leaves*,
from a kind of Yellow, deepens at last into a dark one, as Black as
Pitch.

40. §. By *Distillations*; both with the cold *Still*, *Alembick*, *Chappel-* and
open *Furnace*: and to note what *Vegetables* thus give their
*Smell* or *Taste*, and in what Degrees of strength, either under, or over
their natural ones; as *Mint*, *Pennyroyal*, and the like, which are *Aromatick*
and *Hot*, give their *Tastes* perfect: but *Wormwood*, which is
*Aromatick* and *Bitter*; gives it but by halfs, pretty fully as *Aromatick*, little
as *Bitter*. And *Carduus*, though also so exceeding *Bitter*, yet not
being *Aromatick*, yieldeth a much weaker *Taste*. Also what *Vegetables*
yield *Oyl* most plentifully; and what difference may be in those
*Oyls*, as to their *Colour*, *Weight*, or otherwise; as that of *Cloves* is sometimes
Red; of *Cinnamon*, limpid; both Ponderous. So to distil *Juices*,
*Gums*, or other *Contents*, with an hot *fire*; and to see, what Bodies they
yield, and of what *Qualities*; as *Turpentine* is known to yield, besides

its *Oyl*, a subacid *Water*; *Vinegar*, an Eager *Spirit*; as that part may
be called, which *Chymists* are wont to call the *Phlegm*.

41. §. By *Arefaction*; so *Milks* which are Liquid, and White in
their Natural Estate, in Standing, grow Gummous, Yellow, and otherwise
different, so doth that of *Scorzonera*; and that of *Fenil* becomes a
Balsamical, but Limpid *Oyl*. The *Roots* of *Angelica*, being dry’d, and
cut by the length, exhibit their small *Veins* fill’d with an Aromatick
*Rosin*. In the whiter parts of *Rhubarb*, is gathered a kind of *Saline
Concret*; by which, this *Root*, in chewing, seems as if it were a little
gritty. *Cabbage-Stalks*, sliced, and laid in the Shade to dry, gather on
them a kind of *Nitrous* Hoar. *Raisins* and *Corins* contain, not only
a sweet Juyce, but also a true *Sugar*, which lies *curdled* in the *Pulp*,
as the more *Saline* parts do in Green Soap. And the like is gather’d
on the out-side of a *Fig*; saving, that it is more *Nitrous*, as lying next
the *Aer*. The *Roots* of *Arum*, upon drying, lose much of the strength
of their *Taste*; but the contrary may be noted of many other *Roots*,
which, upon drying, increase it. Some, being cut and laid by, change
their Natural *Colours*, into Red, Purple, Yellow, Green, or White;
as *Liquorish*, into White, in some places; and *Peony*, into Red: and
sometimes into two; as *Patience*, into Yellow and Red.

42. §. By *Assation*; thus *Apples*, by roasting, eat more Sowre. The
*Root* of *Horse-Radish*, toasted, tasteth like a *Turnep*. *Potatoes*, *Onions*,
and many other *Roots*, and *Parts*, have their *Tastes*, either Altered
or Refracted; which chiefly, and in what manner, should be observed.
There is one alteration, as remarkable, as commonly known;
and is that which followeth upon roasting or baking in one kind of the
*Waldensian Pears*, which, for a *Walden*, we corruptly call a *Warden*.

43. §. By *Ustion*; wherein some *Plants*, or *Parts* of them, burn
very quietly; others, not without violent motions; so *Fenil-Seeds*,
held in the flame of a Candle, will spit and spurtle, like the *Serum* of
*Blood*. Some *Vegetables* lose their *Smell*, as *Roses*; others, keep it,
as *Rosemary*; and others, mend it, as *Lignum Aloes*, To note, not
only the alteration of their *Qualities*, but what they yield; as *Turpentine*,
which, in *Distillation*, yieldeth *Oyl* and *Water*, both limpid; upon
*Ustion*, sheweth nothing but a black *Soot*. So *Benzoine*, by *Distillation*,
*Oyl*; by *Ustion*, white *Flowers*, as is known.

44. §. By *Calcination*; and here to observe, wherein the *Caput
Mortuum* of one, may differ from, or agree in Nature with that of another;
and also to compare these with those of *Animal Bodies*. As also in
their *Quantities*. And to compare them with what they yield by *Distillation*
and *Ustion* as to both. Thus far they have been tryed *singly*,
or by themselves. They should also be examined.

45. §. By *Composition*; not only with *Water*, as in simple *Infusions*,
*&c.* but with any other Bodies, which may have a power of acting
upon them, or upon which, these may have a power to act. And so
to make *Infusions*, *Destillations*, *Decoctions*, *Digestions*, in divers kinds
of *Liquors*, as *Vinegar*, *Urine*, *Spirit* of *H. H. Wine*, *Blood*, *Milk*,
or others. So in *Infusions*, some Red Colours are heightned by *Acids*;
Blews, turned Purple. So fetid *Spirits* (as of *H.H.*) may be rendred much
more grateful, by being *Rectified*, once or twice, with fresh *Aromaticks*,
To observe also what follows, upon mixing the *Liquors*, or other Parts

of *Plants* together, as *Oyl* of *Turpentine*, by *Digestion* with a *Lixivial
Salt*, extracteth thence a Red *Tincture*. Or with *Salts*, *Earths*, *Metals*,
or any other Bodies; as the *Juyce* of the green *Leaves* of *Rasberry*, *Primrose*,
and divers other *Plants* (I think principally such as are Astringent)
expressed upon *Steel*, as it drieth, becometh of a *Purple Colour*.

46. §. Lastly, by *Compounding* the *Experiment* it self, or joyning
two or more of them, upon the same matter: as *Fermentation* and *Destillation*,
as is used for some *Waters*. *Infusion* and *Fermentation*, as in
making of *Beer*. *Fermentation* and *Coction*, or rather *Assation*, as in
making of *Bread*. *Arefaction* and *Destillation*, as may be tryed upon
some *Herbs*; and with what difference from what may be noted, upon
their being distilled, moist.

47. §. Having proceeded thus far, by all the above particular
Ways of Observation; a Comparative Prospect must be taken of them:
by which, at last, the *Communities* and *Differences* of the *Contents* of
*Vegetables*, may be discerned; the manner of their *Causation* and *Original*,
partly, be judged of; and wherein it is, that the *Essence* of their
several *Natures* and *Qualities* doth consist, in some measure comprehended.
And consequently, both from the knowledge of their particular
*Natures*, and the Analogy found betwixt them; we may be
able, better to conjecture, and try, what any of them are, or may be
good for. For certainly, we shall then know, more readily, to apply
things unto, and more fitly to prepare them for, their Proper Uses,
when we first know, *what they are*. Notwithstanding, since the *Faculties*
of *Plants*, do often lie more recluse; it is best,therefore, not wholly
to acquiesce in such Conjectures, as their *Tastes*, or other *Sensible Properties*
may suggest; but to subjoyn *Experiment*. In making of which,
and in passing a Judgment thereupon, many Cautions, both in respect
of the *Plant* whereof, and the *Subject* whereupon it is made, are requisite
to be attended. Which yet, in regard they result not so directly
from the Matter at present in hand; I shall not, therefore, here insist
upon them, And thus much for the Third General *Mean*.

48. §. THE *Contents* of the *Organical Parts* of *Vegetables*, having
been thus duly Examined: The Fourth General *Mean*. it will be requisite to make the like Inquiry
into their *Principles*; or the *Bodys*, immediately concurrent and essential
to their Being. And of these, we are to observe, First, their *Number*;
whether well reducible to *five*, *six*, *seven*, or *more*, or *fewer*: and
the Special Differences observable under any one General; since there
are many Bodies, of very different Natures, confounded under one
Name. Next their *Conjugation*; which they are, that either under
or over those observable in *animal*, or other *Bodies*, are here joyned
together in a *Plant*; How far common to the *Organical Parts*
of divers *Plants*; or to the several *Organical Parts* of one; or
how far different in them. So the predominant *Principle* of the *Parenchymous
Parts* of a *Plant*, that it is an *Acid*, seems evident, From the
general Nature of *Fruits*; and of *Corn*; and most *Parenchymous Roots*,
which are either Spirituous, or Sower, or by Digestion, do easily become
such. Likewise their *Proportions*; which stand in the greatest,
which in the least, or in the meaner *Quantities*, and in what Degrees;
both in divers *Vegetables*, and in the several *Organical Parts* of one.
And then the *Concentration* and *Union* of them altogether; as to the degrees

of their Closeness or Laxity; or the manner of their Implication and
Coherency; or as to their Location, one being more Central, another
more Exposed and Rampant over the rest; or otherwise different. To
examine these *Principles*, by their *Colour*, *Taste*, *Smell*, *Consistence*, *Fixedness*,
*Volatility*, *Weight*, *Figures*, or other *Accidents*. And to these
purposes, to go through the formentioned Ways of *Experiment*; as
*Ustion*, *Calcination*, *Destillation*, *&c.* as any of them may appear applicable
hereunto. So the *Essential Salt* of *Wormwood*, which may be
obtained from the *Lixivial*; is *Bitter*, transparent, and commonly, of
a *Cylindrick* figure: whereas that which is obtained by *Coction*, or from
the *Extract*, is *tasteless*, greyish, and almost *Cubick*: and that in the Extract
of the Green *Leaves* of *Violets*, appears in fine transparent *Shoots*,
like so many little Needles. And it is probable, That the *Salts* of
most Kinds of *Plants*, whether Lixivial or Essential; and of these, whether
obtained by *Decoction*, or otherwise, have either their *Figure*, or
other *Qualities*, proper to themselves, whereby they are all distinguished
one from another. And lastly, to make *Experiment* upon these
*Principles*, mixing them with one another, or with other Bodies, or
otherwise.

49. §. I know it will be difficult to make observations of this kind
upon the *Organical Parts* of *Plants*, severally. Yet I have thought of
some Ways, whereby true and undeceivable ones may be made. And
the better to illustrate what I mean, I shall give one or two Instances
of Tryal to this purpose. For the making of which, and some others
of the like nature, I considered, That upon the *Anatomical Analysis* of
all the *Parts* of a *Plant*, I had certainly found, (and shall hereafter
shew) That in all *Plants*, there are *Two, and only Two Organical Parts
Essentially distinct*, *viz.* The *Pithy Part*, and the *Lignous Part*, or such
others as are analogous to either of These. So that, if we can think
of any *Plants*, which will afford us either of these two, though not perfectly,
yet in some good measure, simple and unmixed: We may then
see, by putting them to a *Chymical Test*, what *Principles* and *Proportion*
of *Principles*, concur to *specifie* their *Substantial Forms*.

50. §. To the *Pithy Part*, *Starch*, or pure *Manchet* is analogous,
as having very little of the *Lignous* mixed with them. I therefore ordered
℔ ij of *Starch* to be put into a *Retort*, and with a *Receiver* affixed,
to be set in a *Sand Furnace*; and that all it would yield, should,
by degrees, be forced over; which, besides what was evaporated at
the Neck of the *Receiver*, was about ℔ j. of an acid and eager *Liquor*,
of a heavy and blackish *Oyl* ℥ ss, and of a light *Oyl* ʒ j. The *Caput Mortuum*
could not be reduced to Ashes, by the strongest heat which a
*naked fire* in that Furnace would produce.

51. §. To the *Lignous Part*, *Hemp* or *Flax* is analogous, having
very little of the *Pithy* mixed with them. I caused therefore ℔ ij of
*Flax* to be put into a *Retort*, and manag’d as the *Starch*: whereupon,
it yielded a Liquor, as I remember, somewhat like the former, and
about the same quantity; no *Oyl* which remained liquid, when cold;
but instead of that a *Butyr*, almost of the Consistence and Colour of
the *Oyl* of *Mace*; and of this above ℥ iij, or near six times the quantity
of the *Oyl* which was yielded by the *Starch*. The *Caput Mortuum*
being burned to a white *Ash*, yielded some portion of a *Lixivial
Salt*.

52. §. From whence, I shall, at present, only make these two Remarques;
*First*, That although the chief portion, as to quantity, in
both these *Bodys*, (as in most *Plants*) is an Acid Liquor; yet the latter,
yields also some of an Alkaly, which the other doth not. So that
they are the *Lignous Parts* of a *Plant*, generally, which yield the *Alkalick
Salt*, or at least in the greatest Proportion. *Secondly*, That the *Sulphurious
or Oleous Principle*, is also much more predominant in the *Lignous
Part*, than in the *Pithy*. To these, the like Tryals upon other
*Plants*, should be added; and other ways. So, in regard the *Soot* of
most *Woods*, yields a *Volatile Alkaly*; it were fit to examine, Whether
the *Soot* which is made of the *Pithy Parts* and that, of the *Lignous*,
afford the said *Alkaly*, in equal qantity; or whether, as is most
likely, that of the *Lignous* doth afford it in a far greater: and the
like.

53. §. The prosecution of what is here proposed, will be requisite,
To a fuller and clearer view, of the *Modes* of *Vegetation*, of the *Sensible
Natures* of *Vegetables*, and of their more Recluse *Faculties* and *Powers*.
First, of the *Modes* of *Vegetation*. For suppose we were speaking
of a *Root*; from a due consideration of the *Properties* of any *Organical
Part* or *Parts* thereof; ’tis true, that the real and genuine *Causes*
may be rendred, of divers other dependent *Properties*, as spoken generally
of the whole *Root*. But it will be asked again, What may be
the *Causes* of those *first* and Independent ones? Which, if we will
seek, we must do it by inquiring also, What are the *Principles* of those
*Organical Parts*? For it is necessary, that the *Principles* whereof a Body
doth consist, should be, if not all of them the *active*, yet the *capacitating
Causes*, or such as are called *Causæ sine quibus non*, of its becoming
and being, in all respects, both as to *Substance* and *Accidents*, what
it is: otherwise, their Existence, in that Body, were altogether superfluous;
since it might have been without them: which is so, it
might then have been made of any other; there being no necessity of
putting any difference, if neither those, whereof it is made, are thought
necessary to its Being. Wherefore if we will allow a Body, and so the *Organical
Parts* of a *Vegetable* to have *Principles*, we must allow these *Principles*
their necessary Use; and that the Shapes or other Properties of the
said *Parts*, are as much dependant upon the *Nature* of These; as is the
Roundness of a Drop of Ink, upon the Fluidity of Water, ingredient
to it.

54. §. Again, the *Principles* of the *Organical Parts* being known,
we may from thence obtain a further knowledge of the *Natures*, and
*Causation* or *Original* of their *Contents*; since these *Contents* are not only
included in the said *Organical Parts*, but also Created by them: and
must needs be so, whether we will suppose the *Principles* of these *Contents*
to be præ-existent to their reception thereinto, or not. For, if
not præ-existent, what can be clearer, than that the said *Parts* give
them their Existence? And if præ-existent, yet in regard they are distinguished,
and such only of them admitted in such sort into an *Organical
Part*, from amongst others, as are apt to combine and mix together
in such a *Form*, and so to constitute such a *Liquor*; it is as clear, that
the Existence, if not of those *Principles*, yet of that *Liquor*, is dependent
on the said *Part*.

55. §. And if by means of the said *Organical Parts*, it is, that their
*Contents* become *such* and *such* peculiar *Mixtures*; it is hence also manifest,
That, by the same means, they are of *such* distinct *Faculties* and
*Powers*: Because the *Faculty* or *Power* of a Body, lieth not in any of
its *Principles* apart; but is a Resultance from them all; or from their
being, in such peculiar sort and manner, United and Combined together.
So the *Principles* of the Purgative Parts of a *Root*, as of *Rhubarb*,
although we should suppose them to be existent in the surrounding
*Earth*, yet we cannot say, That *that Earth*, or the *Principles* therein
contained, are Purgative; but only that they are such, as by being
combined together, in such a peculiar way, may become *so*. So the several
parts of a *Clock*, although they are and must be all præ-existent
to it, and it is their *Form*, by which they are, what they are; yet is it
the *setting together* of such *Parts*, and in such a way only, that makes
them a *Clock*. And since we see that the *Mixture* of two Bodies of two
different *Qualities*, as of Two *Colours*, will produce a Third *Colour*,
differing from them both; as Blue and Red, do a Murrey: Why should
not Two or More Bodies of different *Natures*, be so combined together,
as to produce a Third *Nature*? Or wherefore may not that be
allowed to be performed by *Nature*, which by Artificial Compounding
of *Medicines*, or other Bodies, is designed, and often times effected? I’ll
give but one Instance; *Water*, *Grease*, and an *Alcatizate Salt*, may be
easily so ordered as to be inverted with new *Qualities*, *Nature*, and
*Powers*; the *Salt*, to lose its extreme fiery Pungent *Taste*; the *Tallow*, its
*Smell*; and being before unsociable with the *Water*, to mingle therewith:
neither *Tallow*, *Salt*, nor *Water* alone, will fetch out a spot of
*Grease*; but all united easily do it: the same Three Bodys united, are,
in some Cases, as in the *Jaundies*, no ill *Medicine*; any of which, given
alone, may rather prove prejudicial, than a cure: and all this done,
only by duly boiling them together into one Body, which we call
*Sope*.

56. §. Whence again, if it be such an *Union*, and *Proportion*, of
such a *Sort* of *Principles*, which produceth such a *Faculty*; and that
we may, by any means, come to know what these are; we may, possibly,
also attain to the knowledge of such *Rules*, whereby any kind of
*Faculty* may be made; as to Compound such Bodies, which are neither
Purgative nor Vomitory, so together, as to be Invested with those *Faculties*.
And if to Make them, then consequently, to Mend, Exalt,
Strengthen, and Enoble them, with greater ease and certainty. And thus
much for the Fourth General *Mean*.

57. §. HITHERTO, We have considered the *Materials* of a *Vegetable*,
only as Ingredient to it: The Fifth General *Mean*. there yet remains a *Fifth Story* to be
ascended; which is, to consider these *Materials* as they are derived
from *abroad*: or as, after they are received and naturalized, they may,
with others yet abroad, have any kind of correspondence. And these
are *Four* in general, *scil.* *Earth*, *Water*, *Aer*, and *Sun*; all which, in
that they contribute so universally to *Vegetation*, and to whatsoever is
contained in a *Vegetable*, it is therefore requisite, that of These likewise,
Particular Observation should be made.

58. §. And First, of the *Earth*, and of all Solid Receptacles of
*Plants*. Where we are to consider their several *Kinds*; as Mellow,
Sandy, Clayie, Chalky, and others. Their *Ingredients*; as Rank and

Mellow *Earth*, with Sand, or with Clay; or Sand with Clay; or altogether;
and in what Proportions. The *Principles* whereinto any one
of these *Ingredients*, separated from the rest, and put to the Test of
*Distillation*, *Ustion*, *Calcination*, or other, either alone, or by mixture
with other Bodies, may be Resolved. And by their *Qualities*, as
*Colour*, *Smell*, *Taste*, *&c.* both *Ingredients* and *Principles* to be examined.
To make tryal of the growth of *Plants*, in all kinds of *simple
Soils*; either *Earthy or Mineral*, as Clay, Marl, Oker, Fullers Earth,
Bole Armeniac, Vitriol, Allum, *&c.* or *Vegetable*, as Rotten Wood,
Brans, Starch, or Flower, *&c.* or *Animal*, as Dungs, pounded Flesh,
dried and powdered Blood, and the like; that it may appear, how far
any of these may contribute to the growth of a *Plant*; or to one, above
another.

59. §. Next of the *Water*, and of all Liquid Receptacles. Where
the several kinds of *Water*, from Wells, Springs, Rain, and Rivers are,
by their *Qualities* and *Faculties*, to be examined; as these, and by
these, their *Principles*, either in their Natural State, or upon Digestion,
or otherwise, may be observable: since Common *Water* it self, is
undoubtedly compounded of several *Principles*; the simplicity thereof,
not being argued, from its Clearness and Transparency; for a Solution
of *Alum*, though it containeth a considerable quantity of *Earth*,
is yet very Clear: nor from its seeming to have neither *Smell* nor *Taste*;
for *Water-drinkers* will tell you of the varieties of both in different
*Waters*. Besides, if these *Qualities* should be accounted rather Phansie,
than Sense; the difference of *Waters* is yet more manifest, from
their different Effects, observed by *Cooks*, *Laundresses*, *Brewers*, and
others, that have occasion to use them: for not to mix with *Sope*, without
curdling; not to boil Meat tender, or without colouring it red;
and the like, are the vices of some *Waters*, not of others, which yet
would seem, in Colour, Taste, and Smell, to be the same. Tryal should
also be made of the growth of *Plants* in all kinds of Liquid Receptacles,
as *Common Water*, *Snow Water*, *Sea Water*, *Urine*, *Milk*, *Whey*,
*Wine*, *Oyl*, *Ink*, *&c.* Or any of these, with a solution of *Salt*, *Nitre*,
*Sal prunellæ*, *Sope*, or other body. And hereby to observe what follows,
either in the *Liquor*, or in the *Plant* it self: as if any *fixed* Body,
being weighed before its dissolution in *Water*; and if the *Plant*, set herein,
groweth; the *Water*, being then evaporated; whether the quantity of that
dissolved body, continue the same, or is lessened. So, whether any *Vegetable*
will become *Opiate*, by growing a considerable time in a plain Solution or
Water-tincture of *Opium*; and the like. Which *Experiments*, what event
soever they have, yet at least, for our further instruction in the *Nature*
of *Vegetation*, may be of use.

60. §. Next of *Aer*, where it will be requisite to inquire, what sort
of Bodies may be herein contained: It being probable, from the variety
of *Meteors* formed herein; and of *Vapours* and *Exhalations* continually
advanced hereinto; that some or other of them, may bear an Analogy,
to all Volatile Bodys, whether *Animal*, *Vegetable*, or *Mineral*. The flourishings
also of *Frozen Dew*; and the Green Colour, which the *Aer*
gives the Ground or Water, when, for some time exposed to it; and
other effects; seem to argue, that it is Impregnated with *Vegetable Principles*.
To consider also the peculiar Nature of that Body, which is strictly
called, *Aer*, And of that true *Aerial Salt*, which to me, seemeth probable,

that it is dissolved in the *Æther*, as other *Salts* are in *Water*, or in
the Vaporous parts of the *Aer*. As also to try, what different Effects, a
diversity of *Aer* may have upon a *Vegetable*; as by setting a *Plant*, or *Seed*,
either exceeding Low, as at the bottom of a deep Well; or exceeding
High, as on the top of a Steeple. Or else by exposing some *Soil* to the
*Aer*, which is assuredly free from any *Seed*, and so, as no *Seed* can light
upon it; and to observe, whether the *Aer* hath a power of producing
a *Vegetable* therein, or not: and the like.

61. §. Lastly of the *Sun*; as to which, it may be considered, What
Influence it may have upon the *Plant* it self; upon the *Soil*; Or upon
the *Aer*. Whether that *Influence* is any thing else besides Heat: or may
differ from that of a *Fire*, otherwise, than by being Temperate, and
more Equal. That it doth, seems evident from an *Experiment* sometime
since given us, in one of the *Parisian Journals des Scavans*, and which I
therefore think very applicable to our present purpose. If you hold a
*Concave* at a due distance, against a Fire, it will collect and cast the Heat
into a burning *Focus*: but if you put a piece of plain Glass between
them, the Glass will scatter the Heat, and destroy the *Focus*. Whereas
the *Sun-Beams*, being gathered in like manner, will pass through the interposed
Glass, and maintain their *Focus*. As for That, of the Collection
of the *Sun-beams*, by the help of *Glasses*, in the form of a *Magistery*,
or of *Flowers*, and such like, I desire to suspend my thoughts of them,
till I see them. I will only say thus much further at present, That I do
not understand why the *Sun* should not have some Influence upon Bodies,
besides by Heat, if it may be granted, That the *Moon* hath; for
which, it should seem, there are some good Arguments.

62. §. WE HAVE thus far examined the *Principles* necessary to
*Vegetation*. A Sixth General *Mean*. Only hinted. The *Question* may be put once more, In what manner are
these *Principles* so adapted, as to become capable of being assembled together,
in such a *Number*, *Conjugation*, *Proportion*, and *Union*, as to
make a *Vegetable Body*? For the comprehension whereof, we must also
know, What are the *Principles* of these *Principles*. Which, although they
lie in so great an abyss of obscurity; yet, I think, I have some reason to believe,
that they are not altogether undiscoverable. How far they may
be so, I am so far from Determining, that I shall not now Conjecture.

The Conclusion. 63. §. THIS is the *Design*, and these the *Means* I propose in order
thereunto. To which, I suppose, they may all appear to be necessary.
For what we obtain of *Nature*, we must not do it by commanding, but
by courting of Her. Those that woo Her, may possibly have her for
their Wife; but She is not so common, as to prostitute her self to the
best behaved *Wit*, which only practiseth upon it self, and is not applied
to her. I mean, that where ever Men will go beyond Phansie and
Imagination, depending upon the Conduct of *Divine Wisdom*, they must
Labour, Hope and Persevere. And as the *Means* propounded, are all
necessary, so they may, in some measure, prove effectual. How far, I
promise not; the Way is long and dark: and as Travellers sometimes
amongst Mountains, by gaining the top of one, are so far from their
Journeys end; that they only come to see another lies before them:
so the Way of *Nature*, is so impervious, and, as I may say, down Hill
and up Hill, that how far soever we go, yet the surmounting of one
difficulty, is wont still to give us the prospect of another. We may

therefore believe, our attainments will be imperfect, after we have done
all: but because we cannot attain to all, that therefore we should endeavour
after nothing; is an Inference, which looks so much awry from
the Practical Sense of Men, that it ought not to be answered. Nor with
better Reason, may we go about determining, what may be done. The
greatest Designs that any Men undertake, are of the greatest uncertainty,
as to their Success: which if they appear to be of good Import,
though we know not how far they are attainable, we are to propound
the *Means*, in the utmost use whereof only, we can be able to judge:
A *War* is not to be quitted, for the hazards which attend it; nor the
*Councils* of *Princes* broken up, because those that sit at them, have not
the Spirit of Prophecy, as well as of Wisdom. To conclude, If but
little should be effected, yet to design more, can do us no harm: For
although a Man shall never be able to hit *Stars* by shooting at them;
yet he shall come much nearer to them, than another that throws at
*Apples*.

*MY LORD*,

![I](images/i_drop_i_145.jpg)

Hope your pardon, if while you are holding
*That best of Books* in one Hand, I here
present some Pages of that of *Nature* into
your other: Especially since *Your Lordship*
knoweth very well, how excellent a
*Commentary* This is on the *Former*; by
which, in part, *GOD* reads the World his own Definition,
and their Duty to him.

But if this Address, *my Lord*, may be thought congruous,
’tis yet more just; and that I should let *Your
Lordship*, and others know, how much, and how deservedly,
I resent *Your* extraordinary Favours. Particularly,
that you were pleased, so far to animate my Endeavours,
towards the Publishing the following *Observations*. Many

whereof, and most belonging to the *First Chapter*,
having now lain dormant, near seven years; and might
still, perhaps, have so continued, had not *Your Lordships*
Eye, at length, created Light upon them. In doing
which, *You* have given one, amongst those many Tokens,
of as well *Your* readiness to promote Learning and Knowledge
by the hands of others; as *Your* high Abilities to do
it by *Your* Own: Both which, are so manifest in *Your
Lordship*, that, like the first Principles of *Mathematical
Science*, they are not so much to be asserted, because
known and granted by all.

The Consideration whereof, *my Lord*, may make me
not only *Just*, in owning of your Favours; but also most
*Ambitious* of your *Patronage*: Which yet, to bespeak, I
must confess, I cannot well. Not that I think, what is
Good and Valuable, is always its own best Advocate: for
I know, that the Censures of Men, are humorous, and variable;
and that one *Age*, must have leave to frown on
those *Books*, which another, will do nothing less than kiss
and embrace. But, chiefly, for this Reason, Lest I should
so much as seem desirous, of *Your Lordships* Solliciting
my Cause, as to all I have said. For as it is your Glory,
that you like not so to shine, as to put out the least Star; so
were it to *Your* Dishonour, to borrow *Your* Name, to illustrate
the Spots, though of the most conspicuous. I am,

*My Lord,*

*Your Lordships*

*Most Obliged,*

*And*

*Most Humble Servant*
