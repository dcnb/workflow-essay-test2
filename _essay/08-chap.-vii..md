### CHAP. VII.

### Of the SEED, in its State of Generation.

![A](images/i_drop_a_143.jpg)

S the Original, so the Ultimate end and Perfection
of *Vegetation* is the *Seed*. How it is the former, and
in its state apt for *Vegetation*, hath already been seen.
How the latter, and in its state of Generation, we
shall now lastly enquire. In doing which, what in
the other state, was either not distinctly existent, or
not so apparent, or not so intelligible, will occur.

2. §. The two general *Parts* of the *Seed* are its
*Covers* and *Body*. The *Covers* in this estate are usually *Four*. The outmost,
we may call the *Case*. ’Tis of a very various form; sometimes a
*Pouch*, as in *Nasturtium*, *Cochlearia*; a *Cod*, as in all *Pulse*, *Galega*;
sometimes not entire, but parted, or otherwise open, as in *Sorrel*,
*Knotgrass*; with many other forms: I think alwaies more heterogeneous
to that of the *Seed*, by which it differs from the proper *Coats*.
To this the *Caps* of *Nuts*, and the *Parenchyma’s* of other *Fruits* are
analogous.

3. §. The two next are properly the *Coats*. In a *Bean* especially,
and the like; from whence, to avoyd Confusion, the denomination
may run common to the responding *Covers* of other *Seeds*. The Colour
of the outer, is of all degrees, from White to the Blackness of *Jett*.
Its Figure sometimes Kidney’d, as in *Alcea*, *Behen*, *Poppy*; Triangular,
as in *Polygonatum*, *Sorrel*; Spherically triangular, in *Mentha*, *Melissa*;
Circular, in *Leucoium*, *Amaranthus*; Globular, in *Napus*, *Asperula*;
Oval, in *Speculum Veneris*, *Tithymalus*; half Globe, in *Coriander*;
that which we take for *one* single round *Seed*, being a Conjugation
of *two*; half Oval, in *Anise*, *Fennel*; Hastal, in *Lactuca*; Cylindrical,
as, if I mistake not, in *Jacobæa*; Pyramidal, in *Geranium Althææ
fol.* with many other differences. But the Perfection of one or two
of the said Figures lieth in the *Case*. So that, as all *Lines* and *Proportions*
are in the *Leaf* and *Flower*; so all Regular *Solids* in the *Seed*; or
rather in its *Covers*.

4. §. ’Tis sometimes glistering, as in *Speculum Veneris*; Rough-cast,
in *Catanance*; Studded, in *Behen*, *Balttaria*; Favous, in *Papaver*, *Antirrhinum*,
*Lepidum annuum*, *Alcea Vesicaria*, *Hyoscyamus*, and many
more, before the *Seeds* have lain long by; Pounced, in *Phalangium Cretæ*,
*Lithospermum*; Ramified, in *Pentaphyllum fragiferum Erectum majus*,

resembling the *Fibers* of the *Ears* of the *Heart*; some just *Quinquenerval*,
as in *Anisum*, and many more, the *Lignous Body* being in five main *Fibers*
branched therein. The *Figures*, and *Surface*, of These, and other
*Seeds*, See in the Tables belonging to the *Fourth* **Part** of the *Fourth*
**Book**.

5. §. The *Covers* of not only *Quince-Seeds*, and those of *Psyllium*
(more usually taken notice of) but those also of *Horminum*, *Nasturtium*,
*Eruca*, *Camelina*, *Ocymum*, and divers others, have a *Mucilage*. Which,
though it be not visible when the *Seeds* are throughly dry; yet lying
a while in some warm Liquor, or only on the Tongue, it swells more
or less, and upon them all fairly shews it self. On that of *Ocymum* it
appears grayish; on the other, transparent; and on that of *Nasturtium
Hortense* very large; even emulous of the inner Pulp surrounding
a *Gooseberry-Seed*. The putting of *Clary-seed* into the Eye, may
have been brought into use from this *Mucilage*, by which alone it
may become Medicinal. And thus far of the *Superficies*.

6. §. The *nature* of the outer *Coat* is also various, *Membranous*,
*Cartilaginous* and *Stony*; the like *Precipitations* being sometimes made
herein, as in a *Stone* or *Shell*; as in that of the *Seeds* of *Carthamum*,
*Lithospermum* and others. The Designment hereof, being either with
respect to the *Seed* in its state of Generation; as where the *Case* is
either wanting, or at least insufficient of it self, there for its due
protection and warmth. Or, in its state of *Vegetation*, for the better
Fermenting of its *Tinctures* and *Sap*; the Fermentations of some *Seeds*
not well proceeding, unless they lie in their *Stony Casks* in the Ground,
like Bottled Liquors in Sand.

7. §. All *Seeds* have their outer *Covers* open; either by a particular
*Foramen*, as in *Beans*, and other *Pulse*, as is said; or by the breaking
off of the *Seed* from its *Peduncle* or *Stool*, as in those in *Cucumber*,
*Cichory*; or by the entering and passage of a *Branch* or *Branches*, not
only into the Concave thereof near the Cone, but also through the
Cone it self; as in *Shells* and *Stones*.

8. §. For the sake of this *aperture* it is, that *Akerns*, *Nuts*, *Beans*,
*Cucumbers*, and most other *Seeds*, are in their formation so placed, that
the *Radicle* still standeth next to it; That So, upon *Vegetation*, it may
have a free and ready passage into the Mould.

9. §. The Original of the outer *Coat*, though from Parts of the
same substantial nature, yet is differently made. In a *Plum*, the *Seed-Branch*
which runns, as is described, through the *Stone*, is not naked,
but, as is said, invested with a thin *Parenchyma*, which it carries from
the *Stalk* along with it; and which, by the *Ramification* of the said
*Branch* within the *Stone*, is, in part, dilated into a *Coat*. That of a
*Bean* is from the *Parenchyma* of the *Cod*; the superficial part of which
*Parenchyma*, upon the large *peduncle* of the *Bean* becoming a thin *Cuticle*,
and upon the *Bean* it self a *Cartilaginous Coat*.

10. §. The Original of the inner *Coat* of the *Bean* is likewise from
the inner part of the said *Parenchyma*; which first is spred into a long
*Cake*, or that which with the *Seed-Branch* maketh the *Penduncle* of the
*Bean*; under which *Cake*, there is usually a black part or spot; by the
length of which, the inner part of the *Cake* is next inserted into the
outer *Coat*, and spred all over the Concave thereof, and so becomes
the inner.

11. §. Of this Inner *Coat* it is very observable, That although
when the *Seed* is grown old and dry, ’tis shrunk up, and in most *Seeds*,
so far, as scarcely to be discern’d; yet in its first and juvenile Constitution,
it is a very Spongy and Sappy body; and is then likewise (as the
*Womb* in a Pregnant *Animal*) in proportion, very thick and bulky.
In a *Bean*, even as one of the *Lobes* it self: And in a *Plum* or *Apricot*,
I think I may safely say, half an hundred times thicker than afterwards,
when it is dried and shrunk up, and can scarcely be distinguished
from the upper *Coat*. Upon which Accounts it is, in this estate a true
and fair *Parenchyma*. The Delineation hereof, See in the *Figures* belonging
to the *Fourth* **Part** of the *Fourth* **Book**.

12. §. In this Inner *Coat* in a *Bean*, the *Lignous Body* or *Seed-Branch*
is distributed: Sometimes, as in *French-Beans*, throughout the
whole *Coat*, as it is in a *Leaf*. In the Great *Garden-Bean*, upon its first
entrance, it is bipartite, and so in small *Branches* runs along the *Circumference*
of the *Coat*, all meeting and making a kind of *Reticulation* against
the Belly of the *Bean*. In the same manner the main *Branches* in the
outer *Coat* of a *Kernel*, circling themselves on both hands from the
place of their first entrance, at last meet, and mutually inosculate;
as the *Veins* in the *Kidneys* of a Man or any *Quadrupede*; Or the *Carotick
Arteries* in the *Braine*.

13. §. So that all the *Parts* of a *Vegetable*, the *Root*, *Trunk*, *Branch*,
*Leaf*, *Flower*, *Fruit* and *Seed*, are still made up of *Two* Substantially
different Bodies.

14. §. And as every *Part* hath *Two*, so the whole *Vegetable* taken
together, is a composition of *Two* only, and no more: All properly
*Woody Parts*, *Strings* and *Fibers*, are *One Body*: All simple *Barques*,
*Piths*, *Parenchyma’s* and *Pulps*, and as to their substantial Nature, *Pills*
and *Skins* likewise, all but *One Body*: the several *Parts* of a *Vegetable*
all differing from each other, only by the various *Proportions* and
*Mixtures*, and variated *Pores* and *Structure* of these *Two Bodies*. What
from these two general Observations might reasonably be inferr’d, I
shall not now mention.

15. §. The Fourth or Innermost *Cover* we may call the *Secondine*.
The sight of which, by cutting off the *Coats* of an *Infant-Bean*, at
the Cone thereof, in very thin Slices, and with great Caution, may
be obtain’d. While unbroken, ’tis transparent; being torn and taken
off, it gathers up into the likeness of a Jelly, or that we call the *Tredle*
of an Egg, when rear-boyl’d. This *Membrance* in larger or elder
*Beans*, is not to be found distinct. But (as far as our Enquiries yet discover)
it may in most other *Seeds*, even full grown, be distinctly seen; as
in those of *Cucumber*, *Colocynthis*, *Burdock*, *Carthamum*, *Gromwel*, *Endive*,
*Mallows*, &c. *Tab. 4. f. 16.* ’Tis usually so very thin, as in the above-nam’d, as
very difficultly to be discover’d. But in some *Kernels*, as of *Apricots*,
’tis very thick; and most remarquably such, in some other *Seeds*. That
all these have the Analogy of one and the same *Cover*, which I call the
*Secondine*, is most probably argu’d from their alike Natures; being all
of them plain simple *Membranes*, with not the least *Fibre* of the *Lignous
Body* or *Seed Branch*, visibly distributed in them: As also from their
Texture, which is in all of them more close. See this *Part* in *Tab. 4.* As
also amongst the *Figures* belonging to the *Fourth* **Part** of the *Fourth*
**Book**.

16. §. The *Concave* of this *Membrane* is filled with a most transparent
*Liquor*, out of which the *Seed* is formed; as in cutting a *petite*
and *Infant-Bean*, may be seen; and yet better in a young *Walnut*. In
*Beans* I have observed it to turn, upon boyling, into a tender white
*Coagulum*.

17. §. Through this *Membrane*, the *Lignous Body* or *Seed-Branches*
distributed in the inner *Coat*, at last shoot downright two slender
*Fibres*, like two *Navel-strings*, one into each *Lobe* of the *Bean*.
*Tab. 4. f. 18.*The places where the said *Fibres* shoot into the *Lobes*, are near the
*Basis* of the *Radicle*; and by their *Blackishness* well enough remark’d:
but the *Fibers* themselves are so very small, as scarcely to be discern’d.
Yet in a *Lupine*, of the larger kind, both the *places* where the *Navel-Fibres*
shoot into the *Lobes* (which here from the *Basis* of the *Radicle*
is more remote) and the *Fibres* themselves, are fairly visible. For
the *Seed-Branch*, upon its entrance into the *Coat* of the *Lupine*, is presently
divided into two *main Branches*, and those two into other less;
whereof some underly, others aloft, run along the *Coat*, and towards
its other end meet and are inosculated: where about, two opposite,
shallow, round, and most minute *Cavities*, answerable to two *Specks* of
a *Cartilaginous* gloss, *Tab. 4. f. 17.* one in either *Lobe*, may be observed; which
*Specks* are the ends of the said *Navel-Fibres*, upon the ripening of the
*Seed* there broken off. These *Fibres* from the *Superficies* of each *Lobe*,
descend a little way directly down: presently, each is divided into
two *Branches*, one distributed into the *Lobes*, the other into the *Radicle*
and *Plume*, *Tab. 4. f. 18.* in the manner as in the *First Chapter* is described.
And thus far the History. I shall now only with a brief account of the
*Generation* of the *Seed*, as hereupon dependent, conclude this Discourse.

An Account of the *Generation* of the *Seed*. 18. §. LET US say then, that the *Sap* having in the *Root*, *Trunk* and
*Leaves*, passed divers *Concoctions* and *Separations*, in the manner as they
are said to be perform’d therein; ’tis now at last, in some good maturity,
advanced towards the *Seed*.

19. §. The more copious and cruder part hereof is again separated
by a free reception into the *Fruit*, or other *Part* analogous to it:
being either sufficiently ample to contain it, or at least laxe enough for
its transpiration, and so its due discharge. The more Essential part is
into the *Seed-Branch* or *Branches* entertain’d. Which, because they are
evermore of a very considerable length, and of a Constitution very fine,
the said *Sap* thus becomes in its Current therein as in the *Spermatick
Vessels*, still more mature.

20. §. In this mature estate, from the *Seed-Branch* into the *Coats*
of the *Seed*, as into the *Womb*, ’tis next delivered up. The meaner
part hereof again, to the *Outer*, as *Aliment* good enough, is supplied.
The finer part is transmitted to the *Inner*; which being, as is said, a
*Parenchymous* and more spatious *Body*, the *Sap* therefore is not herein,
as in the *Outer*, a meer *Aliment*; but in order to its being, by *Fermentation*,
farther prepared.

21. §. Yet the Outer *Coat*, being on the contrary hard and dense;
for that reason, as it admitteth not the Fermentation of the *Sap* so well
within it self; so doth it the more promote and favour it in the Inner;
being Bounds both to it and its *Sap*; and also quickeneth the *process* of
the whole Work in the formation of the *Seed*.

22. §. Nor doth the Outer *Coat*, for the same reason, more promote,
than declare the purity of the *Sap* now contained in the Inner:
For being more hard and dense, and so not perspirable, must needs
suppose the Parts of the *Sap* encompassed by it, since thus uncapable of
any evacuation, to be therefore all so choice, as not to need it.

23. §. The *Sap* being thus prepared in the Inner *Coat*, as a *Liquor*
now apt to be the *Substratum* of the future *Seed-Embrio*; by fresh supplies,
is thence discharg’d. Yet that it may not be over-copious;
which, because of the laxity of the Inner *Coat*, from whence it issues,
it might easily be: therefore, as the said Inner *Coat* is bounded without,
by the upper *Coat*; so by the *Secundine*, is it bounded within.
Through which *Secundine* the *Sap* being filtr’d, or, as it were, transpiring;
the depositure hereof, answerable to the *Colliquamentum* in an
Egg, or to the *Semen Mulibre*, into its Concave at last is made.

24. §. The other part of the purest *Sap* embosom’d in the *Ramulets*
of the *Seed-Branch*, runs a Circle, or some progress therein; and
so becomes, as the *Semen Masculinum*, yet more elaborate.

25. §. Wherein also, lest its Current should be too copious or
precipitant, by their *co-arcture* and *divarication* where they are inosculated,
it is retarded; the noblest portion only obtaining a pass.

26. §. With this purest *Sap*, the said *Ramulets* being supplied,
from thence at last, the *Navel-Fibres* shoot (as the primitive *Artery*
into the *Colliquamentum*) through the *Secundine* into the aforesaid *Liquor*
deposited therein.

27. §. Into which *Liquor*, being now shot, and its own proper
*Sap* or *Tinctures* mixed therewith, it *strikes* it thus into a *Coagulum*;
or of a *Liquor*, it becomes a *Body consistent* and truly *Parenchymous*.
And the supply of the said *Liquor* still continu’d, and the shooting of
the *Navel-Fibres*, as is above described, still carried on, the said *Coagulation*
or *Fixation* is therewith likewise.

28. §. And in the Interim of the *Coagulation*, a gentle *Fermentation*
being also made, the said *Parenchyma* or *Coagulum* becometh such, not
of any Texture indifferently, but is thus raised (as we see Bread in Baking)
into a *Congeries* of *Bladders*: For such is the *Parenchyma* of the
whole *Seed*.

*MY LORD*,

![I](images/i_drop_i_153.jpg)

F the Dedication of *Books* were not in use;
yet here, I think, I might have been a Precedent.
The promotion of *Phytological
Science* is one Part of *Your* Work; and ’tis
*You* have called me to the management of
this Part; for some time, have intrusted me
herein; and by *Your* most favourable and candid acceptance
of what I have performed thus far, have encouraged
me hereunto: I therefore present but *Your* Own,
into *Your* Hands.

The great Honour and Advantage of *Your* Fellowship,
I first obtained, by Mediation of Dr. *Wilkins*, the late most
Reverend *Bishop* of *Chester*. Whom I cannot name,
without saying thus much of him, That He was a Person

of that eminent and happy Worth, which, as it was
too good, to fear envy; so is it too great, to need an Elogie.

With Him, it was, *You* were pleased to commit to Me,
the further prosecution of this *Work*; the Beginnings
whereof, were by *Your Order* formerly made publique.
Had I consulted my own Abilities altogether, I should
scarcely have ventured upon it; seeing very little, for
which I could think well of my self, saving, That I had
learned, upon good grounds, to think of *You* with greatest
Honour. But I also considered, That to insist hereon too
much, might be a reflection upon *Your* Judgments, who had
thought fit to make choice of Me. And, That *You* were
not more the Patrons of Wit, than of Industry; and of
All, who shall endeavour to find out, or to confirm the
Truth of Things. Withal, I looked upon *Nature*, as a Treasure
so infinitely full; that as all Men together, cannot exhaust
it; so no Man, but may find out somewhat therein,
if he be resolved to Try.

In compliance therefore with *Your* Commands, I have
hereunto devoted a very considerable part of my Time.
These, adding force to my own Desires, of being somewhat
instrumental to the Improvement of Medicinal, and other
wholesom Knowledge: if peradventure, as we increase
herein, we may become better, and more happy. As to
which Improvement, though I could not hope; yet, I
would not dispair. I have already prepared the Soil, and
made some Plantation: what remaineth behind, and the
Vintage of the whole, will depend much upon the continued
Influence of *Your* Beams: for how unpromising
soever the Stock may be; yet the Fruit cannot but be
somewhat matured, upon which *You* are pleased to shine.
I am also confident, that the same Nobilty and Goodness,
which accept the endeavours, will likewise pardon the
faults, of,

*My Lord,*  

*Your Lordships most humbly*  

*and most sincerly*  

*devoted Servant*  

NEHEMJAH GREW.
