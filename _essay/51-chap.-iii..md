### CHAP. III.

### Of the PLUM, and some other Fruits of the same Kindred.

![A](images/i_drop_a_156.jpg)

PLUM consisteth of a *Parenchyma*, the Two
general Kinds of *Vessels*, and a *Stone*. All which
I have already described in the *First* **Book**.
 *Ch. 6.* I
shall here add, and further clear some things.
And First, it is to be noted, That, in Proportion
to the *Bulk* of the *Fruit*, there are more
*Vessels* in a *Plum*, than in an *Apple*, *Pear*, or
*Quince*. As also, That in *Plums*, all the *Vessels* are
braced together into one Uniform Piece of *Net-Work*, every where
terminating at an equal distance from the *Circumference*, *sc.* ⅛ᵗʰ of an
Inch or thereabout. *Tab. 68.* And as for the *Bore* of the *Aer-Vessels*, although
the *Glass* I used, when I examined this *Fruit*, would not reach it; yet

is it to be presumed, that they bear a just Proportion to those in the
*Trunk* of the same *Tree*; and that therefore they are here larger, than
in an *Apple* or *Pear*. The *Skin* likewise of a *Plum*, is more *fibrous*,
*thick*, and *tough*, than in those *Fruits*. The Ends of these Diversities,
we shall presently speak of.

2. §. Of the *Stone*, amongst other particulars wherein the contrivance
of Nature is very admirable, I have formerly shewed,
 *B. 1. Ch. 6.* That
it is composed of Two or rather Three distinct *Bodies*. One of them,
the *Lining*; which answers to the *Coar* in a *Pear*. And is originated
from the *Parenchyma*, which the *Seed-Branch* brings along with it,
through the *Chanel* in the *Side*, and at last into the *Hollow*, of the
*Stone*; and is there spread all over it: as when a small *Glass-Pipe*, is
blown and expanded into a *Bubble*. *Tab. 68.*if a *Bladder*, being stretch-out,
and put through the *Neck* of a *Bottle*; were then blown up, so
as to be every where contiguous to the *Sides*, and become, as it were,
the *Lining* of the *Bottle*.

3. §. The *Foundation* or *Ground* of the Outer and more Bulky
*Part* of the *Stone*, is the Iner *Part* of the *Parenchyma*; and answers
to the *Acetary* in a *Pear*. *Tab. 68.* As the *Fruit* grows, the *Tartareous Parts*
of the *Sap*, being continually precipitated upon this *Parenchyma*, it is
hereby petrify’d. As will best be seen, by comparing the several *Ages*
of the same *Fruit* together. And in some *Stones*; on the Surface
whereof, some of the said *Tartareous Parts* appear in distinct *Grains*.
*Tab. 68.* So that whereas in a *Pear*, the *Calculary* and the *Acetary* are distinct,
here in a *Plum*, they are thrown one into the other. Or, as some
*Mineral Waters* only make a Crust about a Stick or other Bodies immersed
in them; but others, by sinking into these Bodies, do hereby
petrify them: So in a *Pear*, the *Tartareous Parts* of the *Sap*, only
make a *Crust* about the *Acetary*; but in a *Plum*, they sink into the
Body thereof, or that *Part* of the *Parenchyma*, which stands in the
place of it, whereby it is converted into a *Stone*. The *Figures* of *Stones*
shall hereafter be spoken of, when I come in the next **Part**, to the *Covers*
of the *Seed*.

4. §. AN APRECOCK is of the *Plum-Kind*. But some
things are herein better observed. As first, the *Position* of the *Bladders*
of the *Parenchyma*. For the *Tartareous Parts* of the *Sap* not being
here dispersed, in little *Grains*, throughout the *Fruit*, as in a *Pear*;
but all thrown off into the *Stone*: the *Bladders* therefore are so disposed,
as not to have respect to several *Centres*, as in a *Pear*; *Tab. 68.* but only the
*Stone*, to which they all do most exactly radiate; thereto conveying
the *feculent Sap*, in so many little *Streams*. This is best seen, when the
*Fruit* is full ripe.

5. §. In this *Fruit*, while it is young, the gradual transmutation of
the Inner *Part* of the *Parenchyma* into a *Stone*, is also more apparent.
And so are the Three *Coats*, which serve for the *Generation* of the
*Seed*; being now all very distinct; and remarkable, not only for
their *Bulk*; but also, the *Analogy* which they bear to the Three *Membranes*
in many *Viviparous Animals*. Whereof I shall give a more particular
*Description*, when I come, in the following **Part**, to the *Covers*
of the *Seed*.

6. §. A PEACH hath a much bigger Stone, than either a *Plum*,
or an *Aprecock*: and hath therefore, when full ripe, and especially in

hot Countries, a more desecated or better fined *Juyce*. For the reason
why the *Stone* is so great, is because the *Vessels* run so very numerously
through the Body of it; and so cause a more copious precipitation
of the *Lees* of the *Sap* thereinto.

7. §. A CHERRY is likewise near related to a *Plum*. But
the *Bracement* or *Reticulation* of the *Vessels*, is here carried out further,
*Tab. 69.* so as to be all round about contiguous to the *Skin*. And as the *Aer-Vessels*
in the *Branch* of a *Cherry-Tree*, are larger than those of an *Apple-Branch*,
but less than those of a *Plum-Branch*; so may they be presumed,
to bear the same Proportion here in the *Fruit*.

8. §. A WALNUT, is a *Nuciprune*; or betwixt a *Plum* and a
*Nut*, as a *Bat* is betwixt a *Beast* and a *Bird*. For the *Rind*, answers to
the *Pulp*; and the *Shell*, as the *Stone*, is also lined. But the *Seed-Vessels*,
which in a *Plum* run through a *Chanel* made on purpose in the
*Stone*; do here enter, as in a *Nut*, at the *Centre* of the *Shell*. By which
means, they are invested with a more fair *Parenchyma*; which Nature
hath provided, as her *Cloth*, for the making of the *Coats* wide enough
for so vast a *Kernel*.
