### CHAP. I.

### Of the received Doctrine of Mixture.

![F](images/i_drop_f_2.jpg)
IRST,
As to the received *Doctrine* of *Mixture*; not to
trouble you with tedious quotations of what *Aristotle*, *Galen*,
*Fernelius*, *Scaliger*, *Sennertus*, *Riverius*, and other
Learned men say hereof; we may suppose the whole summed
up in that *Definition* which *Aristotle* himself hath given of
it, Lib. 1. *de Generat. & Corrupt.* Cap. ult. and which the greater number of his Followers, have almost religiously
adhered to; *viz.* that ’tis, τῶν μικτῶν ἀλλοιωθέντων ἕνωσις, that ’tis,
*Miscibilium alteratorum unio*. Which *Definition*, as it is usually explicated,
is both *Unintelligible*, and *Unuseful*.

2. §. Two things are *unintelligible*; what they mean by *Alteration*;
and what by *Union*. In this *Alteration*, they say, That the very
*Forms* of the *Elements* are *altered*. And therefore lay it down for an
*Axiom*, *Quod in Mixto, Formæ Elementares tantum sint in potentia*, But
let us see the consequence. For if in a *mixed* body, the *Forms* of the
*Elements* are but in *potentia*; then the *Elements* themselves are but *in
potentia*: for we all say, *Forma dat esse*. And if the *Compounding
Elements*, are only *in potentia*; then the *Compounded Body* it self can
be only *in potentia*; yet to say it is no more, is most absurd.

3. §. As for the *Union* of *Elements* in a *mixed Body*; they make
it such, as brings them at last to assert, the *Penetration* of *Bodies*, and
that the *Union* of *mixed Bodies* is nothing else. For they say it is made
in such sort, that every particle of the *mixed Body*, partaketh of the
*Nature* of the whole. Which *Nature*, ariseth from the contemperated
*Qualities* of the four *Elements*. Whence they conclude, That
every particle of the *mixed Body*, containeth in it self all the four *Elements*.
Which is plainly to assert a *penetration* of *Bodies*. For every
*Element* is, at least, one particle; if therefore every particle of the
*mixed* Body, containeth four *Elements*; then four particles are but one.
I conclude then, That the received *Doctrine* of *Mixture* is *Unintelligible*.

4. §. Whence it follows, That it is also *Barren* and *Unuseful*. For
who can make any use of that which he understandeth not? And the
experience of so many years, wherein it hath been ventilated by the
disputes of men, proveth as much: Scarce any of them, except the
Learned *Sennertus*, daring to venture upon Experiment, for fear they
should come to understand themselves.

5. §. It is confessed, that many gallant things have been found out
by artificial *Mixture*. But no thanks to this *Definition* of it. For as
an *Ignorant* Man may make bad *Work*, and a good *Rule* be never the
worse; so one that is *Ingenious* may make good *Work*, and a bad *Rule*
be never the better. The question is not, what have men done? but
what have they done upon this foundation, *Quod Mixitio sit miscibilium
alteratorum unio*. Had this ever taught them to do any thing,
even so much as to make the *Inke* wherewith they have wrote, all
their *Disputes*; I confess, they would have had something to shew for
it. But the truth is, their *notions* of *Mixture*, have been so far from
doing us any good, that they have done us much harm: being, through
their seeming subtlety, but real absurdity, as so many phantastick
*Spectrums*, serving only to affright men from coming near them, or the
Subject whereof they treat.

6. §. I shall therefore endeavour to open the true *Nature* of *Mixture*.
And I shall build my *Doctrine* upon the *Common Notions* of *Sense*:
which none can *deny*; and every one may *conceive* of. In order to
which, I shall take leave to lay down some *Propositions*, of the *Principles*
of all *mixed Bodies*.
