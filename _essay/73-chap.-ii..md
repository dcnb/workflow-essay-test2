### CHAP. II.

### Of the QUANTITIES afforded by the Parts of several
    Plants distinctly calcin’d.

![I](images/i_drop_i_153.jpg)

SHALL next set down some *Tryals*, upon one *Part*
of a *Plant*, as well *Organick*, as *Content*, separated
from the rest; in answer to these supposed *Queries*.

Quer. 1. *What Proportion doth the Lixivial Salt
of the Pith or Pithy Part of a Plant, bear to that of
the Fibrous, or of the Woody Part? Or whether is
there a Fixed Salt always found in either of them?* A
sufficient *Answer* to which, must be built upon many *Tryals*. At present
I shall mention only Two; one upon *Starch*, answerable to the
*Pithy Parts*; the other upon *Flax*, consisting almost wholly of the
*Nervous* or *Towy Fibers*: of the *Volatile parts*
 §. 50, 51, 52. whereof, chiefly, I have
given some account in the foregoing *Idea*.

Of *Starch*, ℔j yieldeth about ℔¼ not of *Ashes*, but of *Black Coal*.
For though it be exposed in a *Calcining Furnace* to a vehement *fire*, for
5 or 6 hours, which is longer then will serve to calcine most Bodies:
yet would it not in the least part, be reduced to *Ashes*; but to the last
continued (though the fierceness of the *Fire* consumed part of it) as
*black*, as when it was first burnt. So strangely was the remaining part
of the *Sulphur* fixed to the *Earth*; that in flying away, it did volatilize
and carry that away with it. In this *Coal* or *Cinder*, there is not
the least of a *Lixivial* or other *Taste*. And although, upon *Tryal* I find,
That the *Pith* of many *Plants*, as of a *Cabbage Stalk*, will yield some
quantity of *Lixivial Salt*; yet it is probably, that generally, it yields
less than the *Wood*.

Of *Flax*, ℔j yields not above 50 Grains of *Caput Mortuum* or *white
Ashes*, which are *Salt*. According to vulgar conceit, it would seem
to be a very dry Body: yet of 153 parts, 152 are *volatile*, and being
distilled would have been collected into *Liquor*. Hence also appears
the great and unexpected *Variety* in the *Proportion* of the *Earthy Parts*,
as well as the other *Principles* of *Bodies*. Or else, that there are divers
kinds of *Earths*, even in *Plants*, of which, as well as of *Salts* &c.
some are *volatile*. For of ℔j of this *Plant*, there remaineth fixed but
50 Grains: whereas of ℔j of *Rhubarb*, there will remain near 1920
Grains, *i. e.* 88 times as much as the former.

Quer. 2. *In what proportion is the Lixivial Salt found in the Gumms
of Plants? and whether is it yielded, more or less, by all?* For answer to
which, I caused the Eleven following, of each two Ounces, to be
calcin’d, and so observed,

That *Common Rosin*, yields but one Grain and ½ of *Caput Mortuum*.
So that ℔j will yield but 12 Grains. In this *Caput Mort.* there is not
the least particle of *Salt*, it being altogether insipid.

*Mastick* yields gr. 12 of *Cap. Mort.* But not the least part of *Salt*.
Of this *Rosin*, it is observable; That being set, in a *Crucible*, within

the fire, before it comes to have thick fumes, it boyls up with a very
great foame or froath; and is the only *Gum* or *Rosin* (of the Eleven)
that hath this property. So that I suspect, there is a great quantity of
some kind of *volatile Spirit*, which then flies away; and so, in breaking
through the *Oyly parts*, huffs them up to so great a froath.

*Olibanum* yields half a Drachm of *Caput Mortuum*. But it is to be
noted, That the weight is encreased by certain little *Spar-Stones*, which
in the burning of several parcels, I always found mixed with this *Gumm*.
These being picked clean out, the *Cap. Mort.* weigheth not much more
than that of *Mastick*. And is in like manner insipid, when the said
*Stones* are picked out.

From hence it appears, how proper these *Gums* are for the *Concoction*
of *Salt Rheums*;
 *Discourse* of *Mixture* Cap. Ult. according to what I have formerly suggested
from another Experiment.

It may also be noted, that *Rosin* and *Mastick*, seem to be more
purely *Acidoleous Gums*; not only from their consistence which is uniform;
and their *Smell*, which is less strong and more pleasant: but
also from the *Acid Liquor* they yield by *Distillation*; and in that the
young *Leavs* of *Fir*, and especially of *Pine*, are sower; and ’tis probable
that those of *Mastick* are so likewise. Whereby these, and
other like *Gums* are more especially fitted for the abovesaid purpose.
But *Olibanum* seems, besides its *Acidity*, to contein some *Volatile Alkaly*,
and so to be an *Acid-Alkaline Gum*. For as it hath a stronger *Smell*
than the former, so a hotter *Taste*; both the ordinary effects of an
*Alkaline Sulphur*. And being infused in several *Menstruums*, appears
to consist of two Bodies, one of them more *Resinous* than the other.
Of which, it is probable, that the one is made by the *Acid parts* as the
other by the *Alkaline*. Whereby it is very well adapted in some *Cases*,
as in a *Pleuresie*, for removing the *Coagulations* of the *Blood*, or its
disposition thereunto.

*Asa fœtida* yields no less than half its weight or an Ounce of *Caput
Mort.* that is 8 times as much as that of the other *Gumms*, and 48 times
as much as that of some of them. Yet doth it not contein one grain of
*Salt*, so far as can be judged by its *Tast*. Yet the *Strength* and *Loathsomness*
of the *Smell* and *Tast* of the *Gumm* do argue it to be highly impregnated
with some kind of *Volatile Alkaly* proper to arrest those
offensive *Vapours* (to use the vulgar word) which flying, either by
the *Blood* or *Nerves*, from part to part, do often prove so troublesome.

*Gum Arabick* yields one Scruple of *Cap. Mort.* whereof, by the
*Taste*, about ⅓ᵈ part is *Salt*.

*Euphorbium* yields one *Drachm* of *Caput Mort.* of which, by the
strength of the *Taste*, two Scruples seem to be *Salt*. Which confirms
a former conjecture⁠[78] of its being an *Alkaline Gumm*.

[78]
 Of the *Luctation* of *Bodies*, *Ch. 1.*

*Myrrh* also yields a Drachm of *Cap. Mort.* and at least two Scruples
of *Salt*. Of the Eleven, these two *Gums* have the greatest quantity
of a fixed *Alkaly*.

*Opium* yields half a Drachm of *Cap. Mort.* whereof the one half
is *Salt*.

*Aloe* yields a Drachm of *Cap. Mort.* conteining about one Scruple of
*Salt*.

*Scammony* yields Two Scruples of *Cap. Mort.* of which, about half a
Scruple is *Salt*.

*Gutta Gamba* yields but half a Scruple of *Cap. Mort.* of which four
or five Grains are *Salt*.

So that considering the *Dose* of any *Cathartick Gumm*, the quantity
of the Fixed *Alkaly*, is extream small with respect to the *Volatile
parts*: In which, therefore, its *Cathartick Power* doth chiefly reside.

Yet none of the *Cathartick Gumms* are without some portion, more
or less, of a Fixed *Alkaly*; though some of the rest are. Which seemeth
to prove, That the Fixed it self, hath some Interest in the business
of *Purgation*: as by being a *Clog* to the *Volatile*, and so preventing its
being deleterious; or some other way. But the manner of their *Operation*
will better be understood, when the *Volatile Parts* have likewise
been examined.

It may also be of good import, to know, what different quantities
of *Salt*, are afforded by the *Tartars* of all sorts of *Wines*. Whereby,
partly, as well as by the quantity of the *Tartar*, we may be enabled
the better to judge of the *Nature* of *Wines*.
