### CHAP. V.

### Of the Duration of Leaves, and the Time of their
    Generation.

 *Evergreen*, is one degree above a *Plant* which is
simply *Perennial*: of This, only the *Trunk* and *Buds*
live all the *Winter*; of That, also the Expanded
*Leaves*. And an *Evergrow*, is a degree above an
*Evergreen*: here, the *Buds* and young *Sprigs*, do
only *live*; there, they *grow* and are put forth.

2. §. An *Evergreen*, is made such, either by
the *Toughness* of the *Skin*, and *Closeness* or *Density* of the *Parenchyma*,
whereby the *Leaf* is better able to endure Cold; as in *Holly*: or by the
extream *Smalness* or *Fewness* of the *Aer-Vessels*, whereby the *Sap* is less
dryed up, and so sufficient, even in *Winter*, for the Nourishment of
the *Leaf*; as in *Box*, and *Yew*, as also *Fir*, and all *Resiniferous Plants*.

3. §. The perpetual Growth of a *Plant*, seemeth to depend chiefly
on the Nature of the *Sap*. For all *Juyces* will not ferment alike, nor
with the same degree of *Heat*. So that whereas many *Plants* require a
greater *Heat*, as that of *Summer*, for the fermenting and distribution of
their *Juyces*, and so their growth; the *Warmth* of *Spring* is sufficient for
many others; and for some few, that of *Winter* it self.

4. §. AS TO the *Time* wherein the *Leaves* are formed; First,
it is very probable, That in those *Plants* which have *Leaves* (besides
the *Dissimilar*) of Two distinct *Figures*, as hath the Little Common

*Bell*, and some others; the *Under-Leaves*, which differ in Shape from
the rest, are all at first formed in the *Plume*, before it begins to *sprout*;
and the rest afterwards; That is to say, that the former *Leaves*, are all
formed (out of *Sap* from the *Trunk*) with the *Seed* it self, and so
compose one Principal *Part* thereof, *sc.* the *Plume*: the latter, not till
after the *Seed* is sow’n, and so the *Plume* supply’d with *Sap* immediately
from the *Root*. Which *Sap*, it seems, is so far different from
the former, as sometimes to produce a different Sort of *Leaves*.

5. §. SECONDLY, of the *Buds* of all *Trees*, and of *Perenni-Stalks*,
it appears, That they consist of a great number of *Leaves*, all
perfectly formed to the Centre; where, notwithstanding, they are sometimes,
not half so big as a *Cheese-Mite*. So that all the *Leaves* which
stand upon a *Branch* or *Cien* of one whole Years Growth, were actually
existent in the *Bud*. It is also very observable, That although
these *Buds* begin to be expanded not till *Spring*, yet are they entirely
Formed, as to all their *Integral Parts*, in the *Autumn* foregoing. So
that the whole Stock of *Leaves* which grow upon a *Tree*, or any *Perennial
Stalk*, this year; were made, or actually in being, the last
year. A greater *Heat*, more subtilized *Aer*, and better concocted
*Juyce*, being requisite for their *Generation*, than for their bare *Expansion*
and *Growth*.

6. §. LASTLY, of all *Annual Plants*, in which there are several
Successive *Generations* of *Buds*, one under another in one year;
although I have not made the Remarque, yet am apt to believe, That
as the *Leaves* in every *Bud* are all formed together, as in other *Plants*:
so likewise, that the Successive *Generations* of the *Under-Buds*, begin at
certain stated *Terms*: as in some *Plants*, at every *New Moon*; in others,
at the *Full Moon*; and in some perhaps; with both, or every
Fourt’night.
