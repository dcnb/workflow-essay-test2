### CHAP. II.

### Of the COLOURS of Plants by Infusion.

![T](images/i_drop_t_119.jpg)
HE
 next general *Inquiry*, proposed to be made, was
this, After what manner the *Colours* of *Plants* shew
themselves, upon their *infusion* into *Liquors*. The *Liquors*
I made use of for this purpose, were three, *sc.*
*Oyl* of *Olives*, *Water*, and *Spirit* of *Wine*. The *Water* I
used was from the *Thames*, because I could not
procure any clear *Rain Water*, and had not leasure
at present to distill any. But next to this, that yields as little *Salt*, as any.

2. §. As for *Oyl*, it is known, that most *Plants* either by *Coction*
or long *Infusion*, will give it their *Green Colour*. I have likewise tryed
some *Yellows*, and find they will do indifferently well; as *Saffron*,
which, by *Infusion* in *Oyl*, gives it a light golden *Tincture*.

3. §. Divers *Aromatick Plants*, as *Mint*, *Majorane*, &c. being
dryed and infused in *Oyl* give it a double *Tincture*, both *green* and *yellow*;
one drop of the *Oyl* shewing *green*; but a good quantity of it
held up against a candle looketh *redish* or of a deep *yellow*.

4. §. But there is no *Vegetable* yet known which gives a true *Red* to
*Oyl*, except *Alkanet Root*: with which, some colouring either common
or other *Oyl*, vend it under the name of the *Red Oyl* of *Scorpions*.

5. §. These things confirm what we have said concerning the *Causes*
of *Colours* in the *Leavs* and *Flowers* of *Plants*, upon this twofold
Consideration.
 *Discourse* of *Mixture* Ch. 5. Inst. 2. §. 3. & Inst. 5.
*First*, that *Oyl* is the most proper *Menstruum* of *Sulphur*.
*Secondly*, that *Oyls* have a greater congruity with *Acids* than
with *Alkalies*; as I have formerly shewed.

6. §. I say therefore, that in *Blews*, *Purples* and especially *Reds*,
the *predominant Principles* being *Sulphur* and *Acid*, the *Oyl* either abstracts
the *Sulphur* of it self, or at least, unlocks it from the *Acid Parts*;
whereby both of them are bestowed seperately to their like parts in
the *Oyl*; upon which their disunion the *Colour* vanishes: that depending,
not upon either of them alone, which of themselves are *Colourless*,
but upon both united together.

7. §. On the contrary, a *Green Colour* not depending on a *predominant
Acid*, but an *Alkaly*, or some *Saline Principle* different from an
*Acid*; this will not so easiely be imbibed separately, into the *Pores* of the
*Oyl*, but only by mediation of their *Sulphur*. So that being both imbibed
without any disunion, they still retein the same *green Colour* they
had before in the *Plant*.

8. §. Hence also it is, that *red Roses* being dryed and infused some
time in *Oyl* of *Anise Seeds*, a more potent *Menstruum* than *Common Oyl*;
they wholly lose their own *Colour*, and turn *white*; the *Oyl* remaining
*Limpid*, as at the first. That is the *Sulphur* or that part of it on
which cheifly the *Red* depended, is absorbed separately by the *Oyl*, and
so the *Colour* vanishes.

9. §. A SECOND *Menstruum* I made use of, was *Water*. And *First*,
*Alkanet Root*, which immediately tinctures *Oyl* with a deeper *Red*,
will not colour *Water* in the least.

10. §. Next it is observable, That *Water* will take all the *Colours*
of *Plants* in *Infusion* except a *Green*. So that as no *Plant* will by *Infusion*
give a perfect *Blew* to *Oyl*; so their is none, that I know of,
which, by *Infusion* will give a perfect *Green* to *Water*.

11. §. But although the *Green Leavs* will not give their *visible
Colour*, by *Infusion* in *Water*; yet they will give most other *Colours*, as
well as the *Flowers* themselves. So the *Green Leavs* of *Cinquefoyl*,
give a *Tincture* no higher than to resemble *Rhenish Wine*; those of
*Hyssop*, *Canary*; of *Strawberrey*, *Malaga*; of *Mint*, *Muscadine*; of
*Wood-Sorrel*, *Water* and some drops of *Claret*; of *Blood-wort*, *Water*
and a dash of *Claret*; and those of *Bawm* make a *Tincture* near as *red*
as ordinary *Claret* alone. All *Aromatick* hot *Plants*, give a *yellow-red
Tincture*, or *colorem ex luteo rubrum*. All *Plants* with a *yellow Flower*
give either a pale *citrine* or *yellowish Tincture*; and the like. Yet all
give not their *Tincture* in the same space of time; some requiring a
fortnight, others a week, others five, three or two days, and some
but one, or half a day. From hence it appears, that the *Colours* of
most *Flowers* are begun in the *Leavs*; only *Green* being therein the
*predominant Colour*, as a *veil* spred over them, conceils all the rest.
But passing on into the *Flower*, where the *Aer-Vessels*, as is aforesaid,
are under the dominion of the *Lymphæducts*; they show themselves
distinctly.

12. §. A THIRD and the last *Menstruum* I made use of, was *Spirit*
of *Wine*. And here it is to be remarqued; That as *Oyl* rarely takes a
*Red*, there being but one known *Instance* of it; nor *Water*, a *Green*:
So neither *Spirit* of *Wine*, a *Blew*. I have tryed with several *blew
Flowers*, as of *Lark-heel*, *Violet*, *Mallows*, *Burrage*, and others, whereof
it will not take the least *Tincture*.

13. §. Again though no *Blew Flowers*, that I know of, will give a
*Blew Tincture* to *Spirit* of *Wine*: yet having been for some days infused

in the said *Spirit*, and the *Spirit* still remaining in a manner *Limpid*,
and void of the least *Ray* of *Blew*; if you drop into it a little *Spirit*
of *Sulphur*, it is somewhat surprizing to see, that it immediately strikes
it into a full *Red*, as if it had been *Blew* before: and so, if you drop
*Spirit* of *Sal Armoniac* or other *Alkaly* upon it, it presently strikes it
*Green*. Which further confirms what have been before said of the *Causes*
of *Vegetable Colours*.

14. §. It is also observable, That the *Green Leaves* of *Bawm*, which
give a *Muscadine Red*, with some *Rays* of *Claret*, to *Water*, gives a pure
and perfect *Green* to *Spirit* of *Wine*: and is the only *Plant* of all
that I have yet tryed, which doth the like.

15. §. It is likewise to be noted, That both *Yellow* and *Red Flowers*
give a stronger and fuller *Tincture* to *Water*, than to *Spirit* of *Wine*;
as in the *Tinctures* of *Cowslip*, *Poppys*, *Clove-July-Flowers* and *Roses*,
made both in *Water* and *Spirit* of *Wine*, and compared together, is
easily seen. So that for *Tinctures* made with *Flowers*, whether for *Medicines*,
or other purposes, *Water*, with respect to the *Colour*, is the better
*Menstruum*. I say for *Tinctures* made with *Flowers*; for there are
some other *Parts*, especially *Gumms*, as *Gamboja*, *Myrrh* and *Aloes*,
which give their *Tinctures* full and clear, only to *Spirit* of *Wine*. Some
of which are used by *Leather-Gilders*, and others, for the washing over
of *Silver*, so as to give it the *Colour* of *Gold*. Thus far of the *Colours*
of *Plants* as they appear upon *Infusion*.
