N
THE *General Anatomy* of *Plants*, I have assigned
one whole *Chapter*⁠[64] to the *Germen* and
*Leaf*. Since then, I have occasionally made divers
*Remarques* of the same; both with the Naked
Eye, as there, and also with the *Microscope*. The
*Principal* whereof, I shall here set down; without
repeating any from thence; or obliging my self
strictly to the *Order* there used.

[64]
*Lib. 1. Ch. 4.*

2. §. That which in a *Germen*, first occurs to the *Eye*, is the *Protection*
of the *Leaves*, or the various *Methods* which Nature takes to
preserve them from the *Injuries* both of the *Ground*, and of the *Weather*.
To the Instances formerly given, I shall add these that follow.

3. §. AND *First*, it is observable of the young *Buds* of *Ammi*,
that lest they should be bruised, or starved, upon their first *Eruption*
from under the Ground; they are couched, as *Firn* is rowl’d, inward;
each *Bud*, against the *Base* of the *Stalk* of the foregoing
*Leaves*, and most exactly laid up within the *Membranes* thence produced:
Just as the Child in the Womb, lies with his *Head* against his
*Knees*; or as it is afterwards embraced with the *Armes* of the
Nurse. And it is a general Rule of Nature, where the *Stalks* of
the *Leaves* are so long, that they cannot lap one over another, and
where no other special *Protection* is provided; for the bottoms of the
*Stalks* to be produced into broad *Membranes*, as Blankets to the succeeding
*Buds*; as in *Crowfoot*, *Dovesfoot*, *Claver*, *Cransbill*, *Strawberry*,
*Yarrow*, and others. And sometimes instead of two *Skins*
lapped one over another, there is one entire *Skin*, produced from the
*Stalk*, in which as within a *Secundine*, the *Bud* is safely shrowded; and
which, in its Growth, it gradually breaks open.

4. §. THE same is also observable in *Dock*, *Sorrel*, *Bistort*, and
all other *Plants* of this Kindred; with this difference, That every
*Veil* or *Secundine* is not here produced from the *Stalk* of the *Leaf*; but
hath its *Original Distinct* from it. And whereas in the former, every
*Bud* hath only one to it self: *Tab. 41.* in these *Plants*, every lesser *Leaf*, together
with its own proper *Veil*, is always inclosed, with the next greater
*Leaf*, in another *Veil* common to them both; and both these with the
next, in another; and so on to the greatest. These *Veils* are extream
thin, and have very few *Vessels*; being so many meer transparent
*Skins*. For which reason, there is always found a *Mucilage* or clear
*Gelly*, between every *Leaf*, and its *Veil*, and between *Veil* and *Veil*.
The one, thus preserving the other, (as do the *Humors* and *Membranes*
of the Eye) from drying and shrinking up, and thereby from
becoming useless for the *Protection* of the *Plant*.

5. §. THE *Orchis*, and other *Plants* of this kindred, because they
*Spring* and *Flower* early, when the mornings are cold, have a double
*Sheath*, or *Blanket* over all. The *Buds* of some *Herbs* (as of *Plantain*)
having no *Hairs* growing on them, are covered with *Hairy Thrums*. And
the *Nettle* hath *Bastard-Leaves*, or *Interfoyls* between *Leaf* and *Leaf*,
for the preservation of its *Stings*.

6. §. ANOTHER Sort of *Protection* is seen in *Wild Clary*,
*White Archangel*, and other *Plants* of a like Shape. In which, the
greater *Leaves* do still cover and inclose the lesser, not by being lapped
over them, *Tab. 41.* as where the *Leaves* are more numerous, is usual; but by a
*Double Fore-Curl* at the bottom of every two greater *Leaves*; by which
the little *Under-Bud* is embraced, and so kept safe and warm.

7. §. THE *Leaves* of *Onions* are all *Pipes* one within another.
These *Pipes* are every where entire, saving about the middle, where
they have a small *Aperture*; *Tab. 42.* common to all of them, even the most
minute in the Centre: not being a forced *Crack*, but a *Door* originally
formed, for the issuing of every lesser *Pipe*, out of a greater.

8. §. THE LAST I shall give, is that which is remarkable in
*Common Sumach*. The *Buds* whereof, being exceeding tender, *Tab. 41.* Nature
appears sollicitous in a peculiar manner, for their preservation. For
whereas in other *Plants*, they are well enough secured only by standing
behind the *Stalks* of the elder *Leaves*: here they are lodged within the

very *Body* of the *Stalk*; as entirely, as a *Kernel* is within an *Apple*, or
a *Fœtus* in the *Womb*. From whence it comes to pass that the *Basis* of
every *Stalk* is extreamly swelled, as going Great with a *Bud*.

9. §. UPON THE removal of those *Parts*, which are contrived
for the *Protection*; the *Foulds* and *Composture* of the *Leaves* do
next appear: all which are most aptly suited both to the *Number* and
*Shape* of the *Leaves*, and also their *Position* upon the *Branch*. In the
*First* **Book**⁠[65] I have given Examples of these *Eight Sorts*, sc. the
*Plain Lap*, the *Plicature*, the *Duplicature*, the *Multiplicature*, the *Single
Roll*, the *Double Back-Roll*, the *Double Fore-Role*, *Tab. 42.* and the *Treble-Roll*.
To which I shall add *Four* or *Five* more.

[65]
 *Ch. 4.*

10. §. And *First*, in some *Plants*, as *Ground-Ivy*, *St. Johns Wort*,
and divers others, where the *Leaves* are small, pretty numerous, and
grow by pairs, they have no *Fould*, but stand Flat and Tangent, like
a pair of *Battledores* clapt together.

11. §. They have the like *Posture* in *Baum*; saving, that here
the Edges of the *Leaves* are a little *curled* backward. Not *Rolled*, a
*Curl* being but the beginning of a *Roll*. So the several *Labels* of a
*Grounsel-Leaf* are all laid in a *Back-Curl*.

12. §. The *Leaves* of some *Plants*, as *Horehound*, *White Lamium*,
*Nettle*, and others, are likewise only Tangent, but are set with a *Fore-Curle*.
And the several *Labels* or *Scallops* of the *Leaf* of *Common
Crowfoot*, are all *Curled* Inward. But those of *Hepatica aurea*, are composed
into *Double Fore-Rolls*.

13. §. THE *Leaves* of *Sage*, *Scabious*, *Red Lamium*, *Lychinis
Sylvestris*, and others, are neither couched one over another, as in the
*Bow-Lap*; nor plated, as in the *Flat Lap*; but being loosely foulded, of
every pair of *Leaves*, the half of one is reciprocally received between
the two halfs of another, and may therefore be called the *Cleep*. *Tab. 42.*
A *Position* very well suited to the Smalness of their Number, and the
Equality of their Size, not so well agreeing with the *Bow-Lap*; and
the somewhat inward Posture of the *Fibres*, not allowing the *Flat
Lap*. Sometimes, as in *Syringa*, where the *Leaves* are broader, the
*Cleep* is joyned with a *Fore-Curle*.

14. §. THE last I shall mention, is the *Plaite-Roll*, as in the *Lapathum
Alpinum*, which some call *English Rhubarb*. The *Leaves* whereof
are so very large, and the *Fibres* so prominent; that besides and
under the two *Back-Rolls*, they are also laid in several *Plaits*, and under
those *Plaits*, again with lesser ones, all most exquisitely Tucked up
between the said *Fibres*: So, as neither to bruise the same, nor yet to
leave any Vacuity: whereby every *Leaf*, and the whole *Bud*, lie close
and round within their *Veils*.
