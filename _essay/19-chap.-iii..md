### Of the WOOD.

![T](images/i_drop_t_148.jpg)
HE
next general *Part* of a *Branch*, is the *Wood*;
which lyeth betwixt the *Barque* and the *Pith*.
And this likewise evermore consisteth of Two
General *Parts*, *sc.* of a *Parenchymous Part*, and
that more properly called *Lignous*. The *Parenchymous
Part* of the *Wood*, though much diversifyed,
yet in the *Trunks* of all *Trees* whatsoever,
hath this property, To be disposed into
many *Rays*, or *Diametral Insertions*, running betwixt
so many *Lignous Portions*, from the *Barque* to the *Pith*: as in
any of the *Quarters* here before us may appear.

2. §. But these *Insertions* are much diversifyed, according to the
several *Sorts* of *Plants*. So in *Barberry*, *Ash*, *Pine*, *Worm-wood*, they
are less numerous. *Tab.* 22, to 35. In *Elm*, *Wallnut*, *Fig*, *Sumach*, they are more.
And in *Holly*, *Pear*, *Plum*, *Apple*, *Oak*, *Hazel*, are most numerous.

3. §. The same *Insertions*, in *Barberry*, *Wormwood*, and some in
*Oak*, are very Thick. In *Pine*, *Fig*, *Ash*, of a middle *Size*. In *Pear*,
*Holly*, and most of them in *Oak*, are exceeding Small. *Ibid.* Again, in *Barberry*,
*Elm*, *Ash*, *Sumach*, *Fig*, they are of an Equal *Size*. In *Holly*,
*Hazel*, *Pear*, *Plum*, *Oak*, they are very Unequal: some of those in
*Holly*, being *Four* or *Five* times thicker than the rest; in *Plum*, *Six*
or *Seven* times; and in *Oak*, *Ten* times at least.

4. §. In some *Plants*, they are Equidistant; in others, not: in
some, the Great ones are Equidistant; in others, the Lesser; in others,
both; in some, neither. Which *Varieties* are not accidental; but constant
to the *Species* in which they are severally found.

5. §. They are not always visibly continued from the Circumference
to the Centre of the *Wood*: but in some *Branches*, as of *Sumach*;
and in most *Trunks* of many years growth, declining, in some places,
*Tab. 34.* under or over, from a Level, are thereby, upon a Transverse Section,
in part cut away.

6. §. They have yet one more Diversity, which is, That in divers
of the aforesaid *Branches*, they run not only through the *Wood*;
but also shoot out beyond it, into some *Part* of the *Barque*, as in
*Elm*, *Sumach*, *Wormwood*, &c. *Tab. 28,
 34, 35.* Whereas in *Pine*, and some of the
rest they either keep not distinct from the other parts of the *Parenchyma*
of the *Barque*; *Tab. 32.* or are so small, as not to be distinguished there
from.

7. §. The *Texture* likewise of these *Insertions* is somewhat various.
*Tab. 35.* For in *Wormwood*, and most *Herbs*, they are manifestly composed of
small *Bladders*: differing in nothing from those of the *Barque* or *Pith*,
saving, in their being much less. Yet in *Herbs*, they are much larger
than they are in *Trees*. *Tab. 36, 37.* And in many *Trees*, as *Apple*, *Pear*, *Plum*, *Pine*,
&c. they are either quite lost, or so squeezed and pressed together
by the hard *Wood* standing on both sides, as to be almost undiscernable.

8. §. So that although the *Parenchyma* of the *Barque* or *Pith*, and
the *Insertions* in the *Wood*, are of the same *Specifick* Nature or Substance:
yet there is this difference betwixt them; That the *Fibres* of the former,
are so Netted together, as to leave several round Vacuities; or
to make a great many little *Bladders*, whereas, in the latter, they are
usually so far crowded up, as to run (as when a Net is stretched out)
like a *Skein* of *Parallel Threds*.

9. §. Of these *Insertions* in the *Wood*, it is further observable, That
they do not only run betwixt the *Lignous Portions*; but that many of
their *Fibres* are likewise all along distributed to the several *Fibres*, *Tab. 40.* of
which the *Lignous Portions* consist, and are interwoven with them; both
together thus making a piece of *Linsy-Woolsy Work*, or like many other
*Manufactures* in which the *Warp* and the *Woof* are of different Sorts
of *Stuff*: as in the end of the *Fourth Chapter* is further explained.

10. §. THE WOOD is likewise compounded of Two Sorts of
*Bodies*; That which is strictly *Woody*; and the *Aer-Vessels* mixed herewith.
The true *Wood* is nothing else but a mass of antiquated *Lymphæducts*,
*viz.* those which were originally placed on the inner Margin
of the *Barque*. For in that place, there grows, every year, a new
*Ring* of *Lymphæducts*. Which losing its original softness by degrees,
at the latter end of the year, is turned into a dry and hard *Ring* of
perfect *Wood*.

11. §. So that every year, the *Barque* of a *Tree* is divided into
Two Parts, and distributed two *contrary* ways. The outer Part falleth
off towards the *Skin*; and at length becomes the *Skin* it self. In like
manner, as hath been observed of the *Skin* of the *Root*. Or as the *Cuticula*
in *Animals*, is but the efflorescence of the *Cutis*. I say, that the
elder *Skin* of a *Tree*, is not originally made a *Skin*; but was once,
some of the *midle* part of the *Barque* it self, which is annually cast off,

and dryed into a *Skin*: even as the very *Skin* of an *Adder*, upon the
gradual generation of a new one underneath, in time, becomes a *Slough*.
The inmost portion of the *Barque*, is annually distributed and added to
the *Wood*: the *Parenchymous Part* thereof making a new addition to
the *Insertions* within the *Wood*; and the *Lymphæducts* a new addition
to the *Lignous pieces* betwixt which the *Insertions* stand. So that a
*Ring* of *Lymphæducts* in the *Barque* this year, will be a *Ring* of *Wood*
the next; and so another *Ring* of *Lymphæducts*, and of *Wood*, successively,
from year to year. So the *Table*, for an *Apple-Branch*, *Tab. 25,
 24, 34, 28.* sheweth a
quarter of a *Slice* of a *Branch* cut transversly, of Three years growth:
That of *Barbery*, of Two; That of *Sumach*, of One only; That of
*Elm*, of Five.

12. §. Hereby two things maybe the better noted. First, the difference
betwixt the degrees of the *annual* growths of several *Trees*: three
years growth in an *Oak*, being as thick as five in an *Elm*.
 *Tab. 33, 28.* Secondly,
the difference betwixt the *Annual* growths of the *same Tree*; being
not of a constant proportion, but varying in thickness, as it should seem,
according to the *season* of the year: whereby it may appear, what
*season*, or kind of year, doth most of all favour, the latitudinal growth,
or the *thickening* of any *Tree*.

13. §. The *Lymphæducts* thus antiquated or turned into *Wood*, do
rarely, if ever, *Bleed*: but only transmit a kind of *Dewy* or *Vaporous Sap*.
And some of them, as in the *Heart* of some *Trees*, it is probable, That
they transmit not any *Sap*, either in the form of a *Liquor*, or a *Vapour*:
and so being gradually deprived of their *Watery Parts*, become the *Heart*.

14. §. There is this further variety in the *Wood*; represented in
*Walnut*, *Fig* and *Oak*. That some certain parcels hereof, make either
several small and white *Rings*, as in *Oak*; or else divers white and crooked
*Parcels*, transverse to the *Insertions*, as in *Wallnut* and *Fig*.
 *Tab. 30, 31, 33.* For it
seemeth, that, at least,in many *Trees*, some portion of all the *Kinds* of *Vessels*
in the *Barque*, are not only annually distributed to the *Wood*, but
do likewise therein retain the same, or somewhat like *Position*, which
they originally had in the *Barque*. So that as all those bigger and darker
Portions of the *Wood*, were originally, the *Radiated Lymphæducts* of
the *Barque*: so the little white *Circles*, or *Parcels* of *Circles*, in the same
*Wood*, were originally another sort of *Sap-Vessels* in the *Barque*, *sc.*
those which have a circular Position therein.

15. §. In the *Branches* of *Fir*, *Pine*, and others of the same *Kindred*,
there are some few *Turpentine-Vessels* scattered up and down the *Wood*; *Tab. 32.*
and represented by the larger Black Spots. Which *Vessels* are *eadem numero*,
the self same, which did once appertain to the *Barque*; and do
even here also in the *Wood*, contain and yield a liquid *Turpentine*.
Only, being pinched up by the *Wood*, they are become much smaller
*Pipes*.

16. §. THE *Aer-Vessels*, with the *Insertions*, and true *Wood*, altogether
make up That, which is commonly called, The *Wood* of a *Tree*.
The *Aer-Vessels* I so call, not in that they never contain any *Liquor*;
but, because all the principal time of the growth of a *Plant*, when the
*Vessels* of the *Barque* are filled with *Liquor*, these are filled only with a
*Vegetable Aer*.

17. §. In almost all *Plants*, not one in some hundreds excepted,
this is proper to the *Aer-Vessels*; To have a much more ample *Bore* or *Cavity*,

than any other in the *Wood*. In the *Wood*, I say; for in the *Barque*,
there are many *Sap-Vessels* bigger than the biggest *Aer-Vessels* that be.

18. §. The Varieties hereof are very many; in respect both of their
*Number*, *Size*, and *Position*; being, as to these, the same, in no two
*Sorts* of *Plants* whatsoever. First in respect of their *Number*. So in
*Hazel*, *Apple*, *Pear*, they are very numerous; but in different degrees:
and are represented in the *Figures* already referred to, by all the black
spots in the *Wood*. *Tab. 23,
 25, 26.  
22,
 24, 27.  
29, 30, 33. 32.*
In *Holly*, *Plum*, *Barberry* somewhat numerous. In
*Oak*, *Ash*, *Walnut* fewer. In *Pine*, and others of that *Kindred*, very
few; *sc.* fewer than in any other kind of *Plant*.

19. §. Secondly, in respect of their *Size*; which from the first or
greatest, to the least, may be computed easily to about Twenty Degrees.
Thus, many of those in *Elm*, *Ash*, *Wallnut*, *Fig*, *Oak*, are very large. In
*Barberry*, *Plum*, not so large. In *Hazel*, *Sumach*, smaller. In *Holly*,
*Pear*, of a still smaller *Size*. *Tab. 28,
 33.  
22, 26.* So that many of those in *Elm*, or *Oak*,
are Twenty times bigger, than those in *Holly* or *Pear*.

20. §. In an ordinary joynted *Cane*, they are so wide, that if you
take one a yard, or a yard and ½ long, and putting one end into a Basin
of Water, you blow strongly at the other; your Breath will immediately
pass, through the *Aer-Vessels*, the length of the *Cane*, so as to
raise up the Water into a great many *Bubbles*.

21. §. And as they have a different Size in divers Kinds of *Plants*;
so likewise, according to the place where they stand, in the self same.
So in *Holly*, *Hazel*, *Apple*, their *Size* is more equal throughout the
bredth of the *Tree*. *Tab. 22,
 23, 25.  
24,
 28, 29.  
33.*
 But in *Barberry*, *Elm*, *Oak*, *Ash*, very different:
Not fortuitously, but always much after the same manner. For in all
the last named *Branches*, the *Aer-Vessels* stand in the inner *margin*
of each annual *Ring*, are all vastly bigger, than any of those that stand
in the outer part of the *Ring*.

22. §. Thirdly, these *Aer-Vessels* are also different in their *Situation*.
So in *Apple*, *Wallnut*, *Fig*, they are spread all abroad in every
annual *Ring*; *Tab. 25,
 30, 31.* not being posited
 in any one certain *Line*. In others,
they keep more within the compass of some *Line* or *Lines*; either *Diametral*,
or *Peripheral*. *Tab. 22.
 23, 32.*
 So in *Holly* they are *Radiated*, or run in even
*Diametral Lines* betwixt the *Pith* and the *Barque*. So also are some
of them in *Hazel*; and some few in *Wallnut*.

23. §. Whether they stand *Irregularly*, or are *Radiated*, it is to be
noted, That Nature, for the most part, so disposeth of them, that
many of them may still stand very near the *Insertions*. So in *Apple*,
she will rather decline making an even *Line*; or in *Holly*, will rather
break that *Line* into *Parcels*, than that the *Aer-Vessels* shall stand remote
from the *Insertions*. To what end this is done, shall be said
hereafter.

24. §. Again, in *Ash*, the *Aer-Vessels* are none of them *Radiated*,
but most of them stand in *Circles* on the inner *Margin* of every annual
*Ring*. *Tab. 24.
 29. 28. 26,
 27.* Which *Circle* is sometimes
 very thick, as in *Ash* and *Barberry*.
In others but thin, the *Vessels* standing, for the most part, single
throughout the *Circles*; as in *Elm*. Sometimes again, they both make
a *Circle*, and are also spread abroad; as in *Pear* and *Plum*.

25. §. Those likewise which are spread abroad, are sometimes *Regularly*
posited. *Tab. 24.* So in *Barberry*, besides those larger, that make the
*Circle*, there are other smaller ones, that stand, in oblique *Lines*,

athwart one another; almost like a *Bend*, or sometimes, an entire
or broken *Saltyr* in an *Escutcheon*.
 *Tab. 33. 38.*
 In *Oak*, they make rather certain
*Columns*, in the posture of the *Pale*. And in *Elm*, they make, as it
were, many *cross Parcels*, in the posture of the *Fess*.

26. §. This great difference in the *Size* and *Position* of the *Aer-Vessels*,
in the same individual *Plant*, is one ground, for which, I think
it probable, That there are *divers Kinds* of *Aer-Vessels*, as well as of
*Sap-Vessels*. Even as in *Animals*, there are divers *Kinds* of *Organs* for
*Spiration*, and the separation of *Aer*: *Fishes* having their *Branchiæ*;
*Land-Animals* their *Lungs*; and those in *Frogs*, *&c.* being of a somewhat
peculiar *Kind*.

27. §. THE *Form* and *Texture* of these *Vessels*, and the various
ways whereby they may be best observed, I have already described
and shewed in my *Anatomy* of *Roots*.
 *P. 1. c. 4.*
 As to their *Form*, one thing
remarqued was this; That they are never *Ramified*, but distinctly
continued from one end of a *Plant*, small or great, to the other:
as the *Nerves* are in *Animals*. A further and easie proof whereof,
may be made, only by holding up a piece of an ordinary *Cane*,
about ½ a foot long, cut very smooth at both ends, against a full
light: whereupon, if you keep it in a straight *Line* betwixt the
*Light*, and the cast of your *Eye*, and then look steadily, you may
see quite through it, that is, through the *Aer-Vessels*, which run straight
along the *Cane* from end to end.

28. §. As to their *Texture*; whereas, oftentimes, the *Aer-Vessels*
appear to be *unroaved* in the form of a very small *Plate*, it is to be
noted, That it is not only of different bredth, in divers *Plants*, and
usually much broader in the *Root*, than in the *Trunk*: but also, that
in the *Trunk*, many times, the said *Vessels* are unroaved or resolved,
not in the form of a *Plate*, but of a *Round-Thred*. The Causes of
which Diversity, are principally Three; *viz.* The *Weftage* of the
*Fibres* of which the *Aer-Vessels* consist; The deference betwixt the
said *Fibres*, or betwixt the *Warp* and the *Woof*; And the different
*Kinds* of *Woof*.

29. §. By the *Weftage* of the *Fibres*, it is, That the *Vessels*, oftentimes,
*unroave* in the form of a *Plate*. As if we should imagine a
piece of fine narrow *Ribband*, to be woun’d spirally, and Edg to Edg,
round about a Stick; and so, the Stick being drawn out, the *Ribband*
to be left in the *Figure* of a *Tube*, answerable to an *Aer-Vessel*.
For that which, upon the *unroaving* of the *Vessel*, seems to be a *Plate*, *Tab. 39.*
or one single *Piece*, is, as it were, a *Natural Ribband*, consisting of
several Pieces, that is, a certain number of *Threds* or *Round Fibres*,
standing parallel, as the *Threds* do in an *Artificial Ribband*. And as
in a *Ribband*, so here, the *Fibres* which make the *Warp*, and which are
Spirally continu’d; although they run parallel, yet are not coallescent;
but conteined together, by other Transverse *Fibres* in the place of
a *Woof*.

30. §. And as the said *Fibres* are transversly continued, thereby
making a *Warp* and *Woof*: So are they (as in divers woven *Manufactures*)
of very different *Bulk*; those of the Former, being much
bigger, and therefore much stronger, than those of the Latter. By
which means, as *Cloth* or *Silk* will often Tear one way, and not another;
so here, while the *Warp* or those *Fibres* which are Spirally continued,

are usually *unroaved* without breaking; those smaller ones,
by which they are *stitched* or *woven* together, easily tear in sunder
all the way.

31. §. And because the *Fibres* of the *Woof*, are themselves also of
different *Bulk*; therefore it is, That where they are more sturdy,
as usually in the *Root*, they require a greater quantity of *Warp*,
that is, a broader *Plate*, to overmatch them. Whereas, where they
are more extream small, as in the *Trunk* and *Leaves*, one *Thred* of the
*Warp*, that is, one *Spiral Fibre*, will be strong enough of it self, and
so, sometimes, be singly *unroav’d*.

32. §. From the extream Tenuity of these *Fibres*, it is, That
they are very rarely discern’d, and not without the greatest difficulty.
As also, from their great Tenderness; whereby not enduring to be
drawn out, they all break off close to the Sides of the *Spiral ones*. In the
*Pith*, the like Transverse *Fibres* are a little more visible: which first
conducted Me to the notice of them here also.

33. §. All the *Fibres* of the *Aer-Vessels*, both the *Warp* and the
*Woof*, are of the same Substantial Nature with the *Pith* and the other
*Parenchymous Parts* of a *Plant*. From whence it is, That whereas the
*Towy Parts* of a *Plant*, whereof all *Linen Manufactures* are made,
are very *Strong* and *Tough*; these, as is abovesaid, are extream *Tender*
and *Brittle*, like those of the *Pith* and all the *Pithy Parts*. To which
therefore, the *Aer-Vessels* are to be referr’d. And the *Content* of both,
is oftentimes the same.

34. §. From whence, we have a further proof of what I have
formerly asserted, which is, That in all *Plants*, there are *Two* Substantially
different *Parts*, *B. 1. c. 7. §. 13. 14.* and no more than *Two*, *viz.* the *Pithy*, and
the *Towy* or *Lignous Parts*.

35. §. From hence also we have some ground to conjecture, That
so many of the *Aer-Vessels*, at least, which are not formed with the
seed, but *post-nate*, are originated from the *Parenchymous Parts*; which
seem by some alteration in the *Quality*, *Position* and *Texture* of the
*Fibres*, to be Transformed into *Aer-Vessels*, as *Caterpillars* are into *Flies*.
And as the *Pith* it self, by the Rupture and Shrinking up of several
*Rows* of *Bladders*, doth oftentimes become Tubulary: So is it also
probable, that in the other *Parenchymous Parts*, one single *Row* or *File*
of *Bladders* evenly and perpendicularly piled; may sometimes, by the
shrinking up of their Horizontal *Fibres*, all regularly break one into
another and so make one *continued Cavity*; or a *Tube*, whose *Diametre* is
the same with that of the *Bladders*, wherof it is composed. All which,
will appear more probable, and what hath been said, be yet better
understood, when we come, in the next *Chapter*, to the Description
of the *Pith*.
