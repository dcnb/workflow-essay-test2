### Of the Nature of Timber or Trunks, as they
    serve for Mechanick Use.

![T](images/i_drop_t_119.jpg)
HE
last thing I purposed to speak of, is, Those
several *Qualities* of *Timber* or of *Trunks*, by which
they are fitted for *Mechanical Use*. As *Hardness*,
*Softness*, *Fastness*, *Clevesomeness*, *Toughness*, *Brittleness*,
*Durableness*, or any of the same *Qualities*
compounded. The *Visible Causes* whereof are observable,
*Partly*, in the *Structure* of the several
*Parts*; *sc.* the *Insertions*, *Sap-Vessels* and *Aer-Vessels*; as to the *Number*,
*Size*, or *Position* of any of them. And *partly*, in the *Nature* of
the *Parts*; I mean such as is *manifest to sense*. According to our clear
and distinct observing of all which Causes, we may understand,
Wherefore any *Wood* is made use of for any certain purpose. And
also, wherein fitly to apply it to further *Use*. In order to which, a

compleat History of the *Mechanical Uses* of *Vegetables* would very
much conduce. I shall for the present give some *Instances*.

2. §. AS *First*, some *Woods* are *soft*, as *Deal*, and *Sallow*. Yet from
different Causes. *Deal*, from the great *Porosity* of the *Wood* it self,
or the large *Pores* amongst the *Sap-Vessels*. But *Sallow*, from the great
number of *Aer-Vessels* spread all over it. And therefore, though they
are both *soft*, yet will not serve for the same purposes; *Sallow* being
well wrought upon, which way soever you cut it: but *Deal*, especially
the white *Deal*, if it be cut cross, it tears, and will never polish
or work smooth.

3. §. Again, in *Sallow*, by the equal spreading of the *Aer-Vessels*,
the *Softness* is equal or alike in all *Parts*. For which cause it maketh
an excellent *Coal* for *Painters Scribets*. Because it doth not only make
a *light Stroak*, but every where *certain*; and so doth not disturb the
even *Motion* of the *Hand*. For the same cause, *Shoemakers* also make
use of it for their *Carving-boards*. Because being every where equally
soft, it turns not the edge of their *Knives*, Which *Deal* would presently
do; because though very soft in some places, yet in others ’tis
hard; that is to say, on the inner *Verge* of every annual *Ring* of *Wood*,
where the old *Sap-Vessels* grow much more compact and close together.

4. §. AGAIN, some *Woods* are *soft*, but not *fast*; others are
*both*, as *Linn*: its *Softness*, depending on the numerousness and equal
spreading of the *Aer-Vessels*; its *Fastness*, on the closeness of the true
*Wood*, and the shortness, and smallness of the *Insertions*. For which
cause, it is of excellent use for many purposes; and particularly, for
*small Sculpture*: such as may sometimes be seen for the Frames of
*Looking-Glasses*, or of smaller *Pictures* in *Water-Colours*.

5. §. SOME *Woods*, again, are *fast*, and *hard*, as *Elm*. Its
*hardness* depending upon the closeness of the *Wood*. Its *fastness*,
*Partly*, upon the same cause; and *partly*, on the smalness of the *Insertions*;
as also on the fewness of the *Aer-Vessels* in proportion with the
*Wood*; and on the *thwart* and *cross Position* of many of them. Hence it
is, that *Elm*, of all others, is the most *Cross-grain’d Timber*; that is,
cleaveth so unevenly, to and fro, according to the *cross Position* of the
said *Vessels*.

6. §. Hence also it cleaveth the *most Difficultly*. Even then,
when it is without any *Knots*. For which reason it is always used,
as best for the *Hub* of a *great Wheel*. As also for *Water-Pipes*, and for
*Pumps*. Not because it is the most *durable Wood*; but because it
will not *split* or *crack*, either in the *working*, or *afterwards*. For
the very same reason, it is used for *Coffins*; that is, because, it will
not *split* in working: not because it will endure longest under ground;
for *Pales* are always made of *Oak*. So also the *Ladles* and *Soles* of a
*Mill-wheel* are always made of *Elm*; as also the *Keel* of a *Boat*, *sc.* lest
they should *split*: but the other *Parts* are made of *Oak*.

7. §. It may here also be noted, That the *Planks* commonly called
*Groaning-Boards*, lately exposed, as a kind of *Prodigy*, to the view
and hearing of many People, were of *Elm*. The *Aer-Vessels* of this
*Wood*, being, though not more numerous, yet more ample, than in
any other *Timber*. So that upon the application of the *Red-hot-Iron*,
as was usual, and thereby the *Rarifaction* of the *Aer* and *Watery Parts*
in the *Timber*; every *Vessel* became, as it were a little *Wind-Pipe* for

their *Expiration*. And as a great many Drops falling together in a showr
of Rain; so a great many of these *Pipes* playing together, might make
a kind of big or groaning noyse.

8. §. AS *Elm*, of all *Woods*, is one of the *fastest*; So, on the
contrary, of all *hard Woods*, *Oak* is the most *Cleavesome*, or *splitteth*
the most *easily*. The cause whereof is, *partly*, the *Largeness* of the
*Insertions*; and *partly*, the *Diametral* or *Radiated Position* of most of
the *Aer-Vessels*: upon both which accounts, wherever a *crack* is once
begun, ’tis easily continued throughout the *Diameter* of the *Trunk*.

9. §. AGAIN, some *Woods* are *hard*, *fast*, and *tough*. So is
*Ash*, and especially *Beech*. *Hard* and *fast*, from some of the same Causes,
as *Elm*. *Tough* not from the *Structure*, but from the *Nature* of the
*Parts*; whose *Principles* are united in a more exact proportion. Wherefore
*London-Cars* have the *Rings* of their *Wheels* of *Beech*; because it
*tears* more difficulty than even *Ash* it self. Whence also for *large Screws*,
there is no *Wood* like it. But for *Small Screws*, of about an *Inch Diameter*,
*Birch* is the best; as being, though not so *hard*, yet more *tough*.

10. §. THE more *Brittle* a *Wood* is, ’tis likewise usually the more
*durable*. So *Oak*, which, with respect to its *hardness*, is not a *tough*, but
very *brittle Wood*, is almost as *durable* as any. Whereas *Beech*, *Birch*,
and the like, although very *tough*; yet for *Duration*, are of no service;
for there are no *Woods* will rot sooner: and therefore, though strong
enough, yet unfit to make any *Standing Parts* of *Building*, or of *Furniture*;
especially in wet and moist places. Because, these *Woods*,
having a less proportion of *Oyl*, than there is in *Oak*; they are apter
to imbibe the moisture even of a *dank Aer*; by which moisture, they
either *Rot*, or breed *Worms*, which destroy them.

11. §. HENCE it is, that what we call the *Heart* of *Timber*,
as it is more *brittle*, so also more *durable*; *sc.* Because more
*Oylie*. So that which is called the *Sap* of *Oak*, is much more *tough* than
the *Heart*, although the *Heart* be more *durable*. That is to say, the
older the *Wood* is, the *Watery Parts* are the more evapourated, whilst
the *Oylie* still remaine, as a kind of *Tincture* or *Extract* in the *Wood*.
Even as we see, that the older *Seeds* of any one *Kind*, are more *Oylie*
than those that are green and young. So that the *Oylie* or *Rosinous
Parts* of the *Sap*, are a kind of *Embalming* to the *Heart*, or older *Part*
of a *Tree*, securing it from the destructive impressions of the *Aer*. For
which Cause it is, that *Oak*, *Yew*, *Cocus*, *Guajacum*, &c. which are
*Oylie Woods*, have always much *Heart*, whereas *Birch*, *Alder*, *Beech*,
*Maple*, which are very *Unoylie*, have never any *Heart*.

12. §. FROM hence likewise we may understand the Cause of
the *Toughness* of *Flax*: what we call *Flax*, being only the *Sap-Vessels*,
or *Lignous Fibres* of the *Barque*. And generally, the *Barque* of any
*Tree*, as of *Willow* (whereof are usually made a sort of *Ropes*) is
very *tough*. The *Vessels* being here younger, and less *Oylie* than in the
*Wood*. So likewise *Hemp*, is nothing else but the *Sap-Vessels* of the
*Barque* of the *Plant* so called. And *Scotch-Cloath*, is only the *Housewifery*
of the same *Parts* of the *Barque* of *Nettle*.

13. §. WHENCE it is very probable, that there are many
other *Plants*, as well as the above named, whereof might be made
good *Tow*. And of some, especially in some respects, better than of
*Flax* it self. Because that even *Hemp*, although it will not make so

fine a *Staple*, as *Flax* (for all our fine *Hollands* are made of *Flax*) yet
*Flax*, which is but of the same fineness as *Hemp*, will never, by all the
Art yet known, be made so white as *Hemp* is made. The *Qualities*
therefore of the best *Tow*, that can be in Nature, are that the *Staple*
be *long*, *small*, *tough*, and *white*. So that if in the *Barque* of any
*Plant*, we can find these *Qualities*, or any of them, to excell; we may
be sure, it will be of better use, in some respects, for the making of
*Cloath*, or other purpose, than *Flax* it self.

14. §. I WILL conclude with one *Instance* more, and that is
as to *Grafting*. The good and happy success whereof, doth certainly
depend upon the suitableness or respondence betwixt the several *Parts*
of the *Stock* and *Cyon*; as the *Barque*, *Wood*, and *Pith*; and that both
as to the *Number*, *Size*, and *Position* of the said *Parts*, and of their several
*Pores* or *Vessels*: according to the degrees whereof, the *Conjunction*
(*cæteris paribus*) will be more or less prosperous. So that of all
such *Conjunctions* as are found to be apt and taking, and which some
have learned not without long Practice and Experience; another, only
by comparing the *Branches* of *Trees* together, may with little trouble,
and in much less time, inform himself. By the same means, some
*Conjunctions* which seem to be strange, as *Quince* and *Pear*, *White Thorn*
and *Medlar*, &c. do yet, by the respondence of their *Parts*, as well as
by *Experience*, appear to be good. And there is no doubt, but that
many *Conjunctions* not yet tryed, or not known to have been so, may
upon the same ground, be tryed with good success.

15. §. The chief Use of *Grafting* and *Inoculation*, is, That they
*Accelerate* the growth of *Good Fruit*. The *Cause* whereof, is the *Knot*,
which is always made in the *Conjunction*. By means of which, all the
*Sap* is strained, and so ascendeth up into the *Graff* or *Bud*, both *Purer*
and in less *Quantity*; and is therefore better and sooner concocted.
Hence, the smaller the *Fruit* of any *Tree*, though it be not the best, yet
the *Sap* being there, in *less Quantity*, is the *sooner ripe*. On the contrary,
where the *Sap* ascendeth too freely, it doth not only *retard* the
growth of the *Fruit*, but produceth *Barrenness*; as is seen in those
*luxuriant Branches*, where it runs all up to *Leaves*. Hence also *Vines*,
by *Bleeding*, become more *Fruitful*: that is, by the Effusion of *Part*
of the *Sap*, there is a more easier *melioration* of that which remains.
Even as *Phlebotomy* doth oftentimes produce a more healthful and better
*Habit* of our own *Bodies*. To conclude, the *lessening* the *Quantity*,
and thereby the *melioriation* of the ascending *Sap*, by *Knots*, is
*Natures* own contrivance; as is seen in *Sugar-Cane*, *Corn*, and other
*Plants*.
