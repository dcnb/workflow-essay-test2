### CHAP. III.

### Of the Structure of the Parts.

![A](images/i_drop_a_156.jpg)

THIRD enquiry, is into the *Generation* and
*Structure* of *Parts*. The manner whereof I have
already endeavoured to *explicate*⁠[61] from the *Anatomy*
of the *Root*, throughout all particulars.
Some whereof I shall yet further clear.

[61]
 *Lib. 2. P. 2.*

1. §. As *First*, the *Union* of the *Barque* to the
*Body* of the *Tree*, Contrary to the common Opinion,
*That they are not continuous*; but that the *Barque* only surrounds
the *Body*, as a *Scabbard* does a *Sword*, or a *Glove* the *Hand*. As also
seemeth to be proved, by the easy *Slipping* of the *Barque* of *Willow*,
and most other *Trees*, when full of *Sap*, from the *Wood*.

2. §. But, notwithstanding this, they are as truly continuous, as
the *Skin* of the *Body* is with the *Flesh*: *sc.* by means of the *Parenchyma*;
which is one entire *Body*, running from the *Barque* into the *Wood*,
and so uniting both together; *Tab. 19.* as in a *Branch* of *Vine* or *Corin-Tree*,
when the *Barque* is stripped off, is apparent; the Spaces between the
several *Parts* of the *Wood*, being filled up with the *Parenchymous*, inserted
from the *Barque*.

3. §. Now the reason why the *Barque* nevertheless slips so easily
from the *Wood*, is plain, *viz.* Because most of the young *Vessels* and *Parenchymous
Parts*, are there every year successively formed; that is, betwixt
the *Wood* and *Barque*: where the said *Parts* newly formed, are
as tender, as the tenderest *Vessels* in *Animals*. And we may imagine,
how easie it were at once to tear or break a thousand *Vessels* or *Fibres*
of an *Embrio*, of a *Womb* or *Egg*.

4. §. THE same *Vessels* of the *Barque* being always *braced*, and
gradually falling off, together with the *Parenchyma*, into the utmost
*Rind*: Hence it is, that the *Barques* of many *Trees*, are as it were, *Tab. 19.* latticed
with several *Cracks* of divers *Sizes*, and sometimes in the *Figure* of
*Rombs*: the said *Fissures* representing the *Position* and *Tract* of the
*Vessels* in their *Braces*. Hence also it is, that the *Barque* of some *Trees*,
as of *Corin*, *Cherry*, &c. falleth off in *Rings*, *sc.* because the *Sap-Vessels*
are posited in the same manner in the *Barque*.

5. §. The *Sap-Vessels*, as they are generated at the inner *Verge* of
the *Barque*: so likewise, in a small quantity, at the utmost *Verge* of the
*Pith*. These being not only fed with a more vigorous *Sap*, but with
great caution, secured within the *Wood*, for the propagation of the
succeeding *Buds*.

6. §. Hence also it is, that is, by the annual accretion of these
*Vessels*, that the *Pith* is sometimes less in the *Trunk*, than in the *Branches*; *Tab. 18.*
and less in the elder *Branches*, than in the younger; and sometimes ’tis
almost wholly filled up. By which means, as the *Branches* carry every
year a greater burthen; so they become still more sturdy the better to
support it.

7. §. SOMETIMES also the *Pith* breaks and shrinks up, thus
making the *Trunk* a *Pipe*. The cause whereof, is either the *Largeness*
of its *Pores*, or the *Thinness* of the *Sides* of the said *Pores*; upon both

which accounts, the *Pith* doth more easily tear, and upon tearing
shrink up, and so become hollow: as in *Cichory*, *Lampsana*, *Sonchus*,
*Teasel*, *Brownwort*, and others; wherein the *Pores* of the *Pith* are
*Large*, and the *Sides* of the *Pores*, *Thin*. Whereas, upon contrary accounts,
the *Piths* of most *Trees*, remain perpetually entire.

8. §. THE Reason why *Plants* are made thus to become *hollow*,
is *partly*, for the *ripening* of the *Fruit* or *Seed*; which is the better effected
by a more plentiful supply of *Aer* continually received into their
hollow *Trunks*. For by means of that *Aer*, part of the *Sap*, is dryed up,
and the remaining part of it made warmer, and so sooner matured.

9. §. *Partly*, for the better determining the due *Age* of the *Plant*.
Hence it is, that the greater part of *Annual Trunks*, are hollow: the
*Aer* contained in that hollow, drying up the *Sap*, and shrinking up the
*Sap-Vessels* so far, as to hinder the free motion of the *Sap* therein; from
whence the *Plant* must needs perish. So that as the *Content* of the
*Aer-Vessels*, is a kind of *Vegetable Aer*, whose Office is to *Attenuate*, and
*Ferment* the *Juyces* of *Plants*: so the *Content* of these *Cavities*, cometh
nearer to a more common *Aer*, designed chiefly, so soon as it is convenient,
to *dry* them up.

10. §. AGAIN, as to the *Aer-Vessels*, divers questions may be
asked. As how it comes to pass, that they are generally less in the
*Trunk* of the same *Plant*, than in the *Root*? The Cause whereof is,
that here in the *Trunk* they are more under the power of the *Aer*;
both that which entreth in at the *Trunk*, and that which of its own
*Nature* ascendeth up into it from the *Root*. For the *Aer*, as we have
elsewhere said, is the *Mould* of the *Aer-Vessels*; to whose crooked or at
least, *Acid Parts*, the *Saline*, and other *Principles* concurring to their generation,
do conform. To which they do best, the smaller they are:
the *Fibres* of the larger *Aer-Vessels* making greater *Circles*, and so coming
nearer to a *right Line*, answerable to the *Figure* of the Particles, not of
the *Aerial*, but of the *Saline Principle*.

11. §. Wherefore as the *Aer-Vessels* may be observed still to be dilated
or widened towards the lower parts of the *Root*, the *Aerial Principle*
being there less predominant, and the *Saline* more: So towards the
upper part of the *Trunk*, to be contracted or grow smaller; the *Aerial
Principle* being here more predominant, and the *Saline* less.

12. §. FOR the same cause it may be observed, That the *Aer-Vessels*
of the Second years Growth, and the several years succeeding, are usually
nearer of one Size, than those of the *Second* and *First*; all being
under a less power of the *Aer*, than the *First*. For the first year the
*Pith* being full of *Liquor*, the *Aer-Vessels* themselves, are the only *Repositories*
of the *Aer*. Whereas after the first year, the *Pith* becoming dry,
or another great *Repository* for the *Aer*; the *Aer-Vessels* are henceforth
filled with a moister or more *Vaporous* and *Saline Aer*, and so made to
grow wider.

13. §. Hence the very *Size* of the *Pith*, hath much *influence* upon
the *Aer-Vessels*, and the manner of *Nutrition*, and the *Generation* of *Liquors*
in *Plants*.

14. §. BUT for the most part, the *Aer-Vessels* are somewhat,
more or less, amplified in every new *Annual Ring*; or at least to a certain
number of years. Probably, because in the elder *Branches*, the *Spiral
Fibres*, of which the *Vessels* consist, are more bulky; and so make a

*Vessel* of a wider, as a more agreeable bore. Nature obtaining hereby,
that the Quantity of *Aer*, shall always be answerable to the
Growth of the *Plant*, or at least, be sufficient to maintain its *Vegetable
Life* and *Vigour*.

15. §. And therefore, as is above hinted, it seems likely, That after
a certain number of years, the *Aer-Vessels* are no longer amplified, but
stand at a stay, and perhaps may grow smaller, according as the *Tree* is
less or more *Longæve*; and that after this period, it is some way or other
in its Declining State.

16. §. LASTLY, from the *Content* and *Governing Principle* of
the *Aer-Vessels*, the *Time*, when they begin every year to be formed, or
to appear, is always *later*; at least with respect to the *season* of the
*Tree*. So that whereas the *Sap-Vessels* begin to be formed in *Spring*:
these, not till the latter end of *Summer*, or there about; at least not
till about that time to *appear*. That is, when the *Sap* begins to decrease,
and to grow more *Aery*; and so more fit matter for the *Generation*
of the said *Aer-Vessels*.
