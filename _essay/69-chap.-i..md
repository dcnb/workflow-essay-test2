### CHAP. I.

### What is generally to be observed upon the Affusion of the
Menstruum; and what, particularly of Vegetable Bodies.

![T](images/i_drop_t_150.jpg)
HE
 Bodies whereupon I made tryal, were of all
kinds, *Animal*, *Vegetable*, and *Mineral*. Amongst
*Vegetables*, such as these, *scil.* *Date-stones*, *Ginger*,
*Colocynthis*, *Pyrethrum*, *Hawthorn-stones*, *Staphisagria*,
*Euphorbium*, the *Arenulæ* in Pears, *Semen
Milii Solis*, *Tartar*, *Spirit* of *Scurvygrass*, *Spirit*
of *Wine*, &c.

2. §. Amongst *Minerals*, several sorts of
*Earths*, *Stones*, *Ores*, *Metals*, *Sulphurs*, and *Salts*.

3. §. Amongst *Animals*; such as these, *scil.* *Hairs*, *Hoofs*, *Horns*,
*Shells*, and *shelly Insects*, *Bones*, *Flesh*, and the several *Viscera*, *Silk*,
*Blood*, *Whites* and *Yelks* of *Eggs*, *Sperma Ceti*, *Civet*, *Musk*, *Castor*,
*Gall*, *Urine*, *Dungs*, *animal Salts* and *Stones*.

4. §. The *Liquors* which I poured hereupon severally, were these,
*sc.* *Spirit* of *Salt Armoniac*, *Spirit* of *Harts-Horn*, *Spirit* of *Nitre*, *Aqua
fortis*, *Oyl* of *Salt*, *Oyl* of *Sulphur*, and *Oyl* of *Vitriol*; commonly
so called.

5. §. In the *Mixture* of these Bodies, two things, in general, are
all along to be observed, *viz.* *First*, which they are, that make *any*,
or *no Luctation*. For, as some which seem to promise it, make none:
So, many, contrary to expectation, make a considerable one.

6. §. *Next*, the *manner* wherein the *Luctation* is made; being with
much variety in these *five* sensible *Effects*. 1. *Bullition*; when the
Bodies mixed produce only a certain quantity of froth or bubbles.
2. *Elevation*; when, like Paste in baking, or Barm in the working of
Beer, they swell and huff up. 3. *Crepitation*; when, they make a

kind of hissing and sometimes a crackling noise. 4. *Effervescence*; then
only and properly so called, when they produce some degree of heat.
5. *Exhalation*; when not only fumes, but visible steams are produced.

7. §. Of all these, sometimes one only happens, sometimes two or
more are concomitant. Sometimes the *Luctation* begins presently upon
mixture, and sometimes not till after some intermission. In some bodies,
it continues a great while; in others, is almost instantaneous:
Examples of all which I shall now produce; beginning with *Vegetables*,
as affording the least variety.

8. §. *And first, if we take Spirit or Oyl of Salt, Oyl of Vitriol, Spirit
of Nitre, or Aqua fortis, and pour them severally upon the several parts of
Vegetables, as Roots, Woods, Stones, &c. we shall find, that they are,
generally far less apt to make a Luctation, than either Animal, or subterraneal
Bodies.* Whence, as from one argument, it seemeth evident, That
in most *Vegetables*, and in most of their parts, the predominant *Salt* is
an *Acid*. But that, on the contrary, the predominant *Salt* in most
*Minerals*, and parts of *Animals*, is an *Alkaly*: in the former, usually
a *fixed*; in the latter, a *volatile Alkaly*.

9. §. *Again, although the Luctation which most Vegetables, and most
of their parts make with Acids, be but small, yet some they make; especially
with some Acids, as with Spirit of Nitre and Aqua fortis.* Whence
it seemeth plain, That there is an *Alkaline Salt* existent in many *Vegetables*,
even in their *natural estate*; and that it is not made *Alkaline*, but
only *Lixivial*, by the *fire*. Or, there is some quantity of a *Salt*, call
it what we will, in the said Bodies, which is so far different from an *Acid*,
as to make a *Luctation* therewith. But to give particular instances
of the several *proportions*, or *manner* of *Mixture*, wherein it appears
to be in several *Plants*.

10. §. *And first, of all vegetable Bodies, Date-stones are amongst the
least apt to make a Luctation with Acids, if they may be said to make any at
all.* Hence they are not so potent *Nephriticks*, as many other Stones,
which make a more sensible *Luctation*.

11. §. *Ginger makes a small Bullition* with *Aqua fortis, only observable
by a Glass*. Hence the *pungency* of Ginger lyeth in a *sulphureous* and
*volatile Salt*, which yet is very little *Alkalizate*.

12. §. *Scurvygrass-seeds make a very small Bullition with Aqua fortis,
like that of Ginger. So doth also the Seed of Purslane.* Hence, although
there is much more of a certain kind of *volatile Salt* in Ginger or
Scurvygrass, than in *Purslane*; yet there is little more of an *Alkaly* in
any one, than in an other.

13. §. *The Pulp of Colocynthis, Fruit-Stones, the stony Covers of
the Seeds of Elder, of white Bryony, of Violets, and others, with Aqua
fortis make a Bullition just perceivable without a Glass.* Hence it appears,
That the great *Cathartick* power of *Colocynthis* lieth not so much
in an *Alkaly*, as an *Acid*; as making a much less *Bullition*, than some
other *vegetable Bodies*, which are less *Cathartick*. For which reason
likewise it is, That the best Correctors, or Refractors of the force of
*Colocynthis*, are some kinds of *Alkalies*, as particularly that of *Urine*,
as *Riverius* hath somewhere observed.

14. §. *The Root of Pyrethrum, with Aqua fortis, makes a Bullition
and huff, in a short time.* Hence, the Cause of a *durable Heat*, upon the
Tongue, is an *Alkalizate Sulphur*. For the Heat of Ginger, though

*greater*; yet abideth *nothing near so long* as that of *Pyrethrum*; which,
as is said, maketh also a more sensible *Bullition* with *Acids*.

15. §. *Kermes-berries, commonly, but ignorantly, so called, with the
said Liquor, huff up to an equal height, but in a somewhat longer time.*
Hence they are gently *astringent*; *scil.* as their *Alkaly* binds in with
some preternatural *Acid* in the stomach.

16. §. *Hawthorn-stones, with Aqua fortis, huff up equally with the
former Body; but the Bullition is not so visible. The life is also observable
of Medlar-stones.* Hence, as they contain a middle quantity of an
*Alkaly*, they are not insignificantly used against the *Stone*.

17. §. *Seeds of Staphisagria, with Aqua fortis, make a Bullition still
more visible. But it quickly ends.* This confirms what was said before,
*sc.* That the cause of a *durable Heat* is an *Alkaline Sulphur*; these
Seeds producing a *durable Heat*, as doth the Root of *Pyrethrum*.

18. §. *The Seeds also of red Roses, Borage, and Comfrey do all with
Aqua fortis make a considerable Bullition and huff; and that very quickly.*
So that amongst all Shells and Stones, those generally make the greatest
*Bullition*, which are the hardest and the brittlest, and so the fullest of
*Salt*.

19. §. *Euphorbium makes a Bullition yet more considerable, with much
froth, and very quickly.* From which Experiment, compared with two
of the former, it appears, That *Euphorbium* is not an *Acid*, but an *Alkaline
Gum*. As also, that the cause of its so very *durable Heat*, is an
*alkaline Sulphur*, as of *Pyrethrum* and *Staphisagria* hath been said. It
seems also hence evident, that the power of all great *Sternutatories*
lyeth not in their *Acid*, but their *Alkalies*.

20. §. *The Arenulæ or little stones in Pears, cluster’d round about the
Coar, with Aqua fortis, presently huff up, and make a great Bullition and
Effervescence, much greater than do any of the Bodies above-named.* Whence,
although, so far as I know, they have never yet been used in *Medicine*;
yet it is probable, that they are a more potent and effectual *Nephritick*,
than any of the Bodies aforsaid, some of which are usually prescribed.
It is hence also manifest, That, according to what I have elsewhere said,
 *Anat.* of *Plants, B. 1. Ch. 6.*
for the sweetning of the Fruit and Seed, the *Tartareous* and *Alkaline*
parts of the *Sap*, are *precipitated* into their Stones, stony parts, and
Shells.

21. §. *The last Instance shall be in the shells of the Seeds of Milium
Solis; which not only with Aqua fortis, but some other Acids, make a
greater and quicker Bullition and Effervescence, than any other vegetable
Body, upon which I have yet made tryal, in its natural estate.* Hence, as
well as from divers of the last fore-going Instances, we have a clear
confirmation of what I have, towards the beginning of this Discourse,
affected; *sc.* That there is some kind of *Alkaline Salt* in *Plants*, even in
their *natural estate*. As also, that they are as significantly used against
the Stone, *quatenus alkalizate*, as *Millipedes*, *Egg-shells*, or any other
*testaceous Bodies* of the same strength. To these I shall subjoyn one or
two Examples of Vegetable Bodies which are more or less altered from
their *natural estate*.

22. §. *Neither Crystals of Tartar, nor Tartar it self (although they have
some store of alkaline mixed with their acid parts) make any Effervescence
with Acids, but only with Alkalites, as Spirit of Harts-Horn, &c.* Hence
the *calculous sediment* or *Arenulæ* in *Urine*, may not so properly be called

the *Tartareous part* of the *Urine*; the events following the mixture hereof
with the aforesaid *Salts*, being quite contrary; as will be seen in the
*Last Chapter*.

23. §. *Spirit of Scurvy-grass maketh no Luctation with any Acid.*
Hence (as from a former Experiment was above-noted) it seems, That
there may be a kind of *volatile Salt*, which is neither *acid*, nor *alkaline*;
such as this of *Scurvygrass* and other like *Plants* seems to be: yet
contrary to an *acid*; as experience shews in their efficacy against the
*acid Scurvy*.

24. §. *Rectified Spirit of Wine, both with Spirit of Nitre, and with
Oil of Vitriol, severally, maketh a little Luctation.* Which argues, that
there is contained, even in this Spirit, some portion of a *volatile Alkaly*.

25. §. *Spirit of Wine, and double Aqua fortis, as the strongest is called,
make an effervescence so vehement, as plainly to boil.*

26. §. *Besides the vehemency hereof, there is another surprizing circumstance.
For whereas all other Liquors which make an Effervescence together,
will do it in any proportion assigned, although but one drop to a
thousand: these two,* sc. *rectified Spirit of Wine and Aqua fortis, require
a certain proportion the one to the other. For if, suppose, into six
drops of Spirit of Wine you put but two or three of Aqua fortis, they stir
no more than if you put in so much Water: but drop in about seven or
eight drops of Aqua fortis, and they presently boil up with very great vehemency.*
Hence we may conceive the reason of the sudden access of an
*acute Disease*, and of its *Crisis*. These not beginning *gradually with
the Cause*; but then, when the *Cause* is arrived unto such an ἀκμὴ, or
such a certain *Proportion*, as is necessary to bring Nature to the contest.
And these may serve for Examples upon *Vegetables*.
