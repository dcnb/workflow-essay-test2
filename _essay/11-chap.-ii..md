### CHAP. II.

### Of the SKIN.

![I](images/i_drop_i_145.jpg)

NEXT proceed to the several *Parts* whereof a
*Root* is Compounded. The outer *Part* of all is the
*Skin*; which is common to all *Roots*. ’Tis diversly
Coloured: Whiter in *Skirrets*; Yellow, in *Dock*;
Red, in *Potato*; Brown, in *Lovage*; Black, in *Bugloss*.
Its Surface, sometimes Smooth, as in *Hors-radish*;
Rough, as in *Scorzonera*. And the *Skins*
of the several *Shells* of a *Tulip-Root*, taken up fresh, look as if they
were perforated with a great many small holes. ’Tis of various Size;
very Thin, in *Parsnep*; somewhat Thick, in *Bugloss*; very Thick in *Iris*.
Sometimes it is Opacous, as in *Thistle*; and sometimes Transparent, as
in *Madder*.

2. §. Every *Root* hath successively two kinds of *Skins*: the one,
Coëtaneous with the other *Parts*; and hath its original from that
which involved the *Parts* of the *Seed* it self. The other, Postnate,
succeeding in the room of the former, as the *Root* ageth; and is originated
from the *Bark*. So in *Dandelyon*, the old *Skin*, looked upon
about the beginning of *May*, seems to have been one of those several

*Rings*, which the precedent year composed the *Cortical Body* of the
*Root*: but by the Generation of a new *Ring*, next the *Wood*, is now
thrust off and shrunk up into a *Skin*. *Tab. 14, 15.* So also in the *Roots* of *Bugloss*
and *Horse-Radish*, as far as the *Bladders* in the former, and the *Vessels*
in the latter are Radiated; the *Cortical Body* seems either annually or
oftener, to shrink up into another new *Skin*, as, the old ones fall off.
*Tab. 10.* And sometimes, perhaps, as in *Assparagus*, the whole body of the Perpendicular
*Roots*, except the woody *Fibre* in the Centre, becomes the
second *Skin*. So that the wearing away of the old *Skin*, succeeds the
derivation of the new one; as in Descending *Roots*, the Consumption
of the Lower *Parts*, doth the Generation of the Upper. Because
the *Barque* swells, and grows sometimes faster than the *Skin* can fall
off, or give way to it: therefore are the *Roots* of many *Herbs*, Barquebound,
as well as the *Trunks* of *Trees*.

3. §. This *Skin* is usually, if not always, compounded of two
Kinds of Bodies: which also is probable of the Coëtaneous. The one,
*Parenchymous*, and frequently constructed of exceeding little *Cells* or
*Bladders*; which in some *Roots*, as of *Asparagus*, cut traverse, and
viewed through a *Microscope*, are plainly visible. *Tab. 10.* These *Bladders* are
of different Sizes; in *Buglos*, larger; in *Asparagus* less; and sometimes
they coincide and disappear. *Tab. 14.* But in these, and all other *Roots*,
even where these *Bladders* appear nor, the *Parenchyma* of the *Skin*,
is of the same Substantial *Nature*, with that other more vivid and bulky
one of the *Bark*: As is manifest, from its being thence Originated;
and alike Conformed, as shall be seen; and not only adjacent to it, as a
Glove is to the Hand; but continuous therewith, as the parts of a
piece of flesh, are one with another.

4. §. OF THIS *Parenchymous Body*, the *Skin* consisteth chiefly,
but not wholly; there being many *Lignous Vessels* which are Tubulary,
mixed therewith: which, though hardly by the *Microscope*, yet
otherwise, is demonstrable. For in tearing the *Skin*, you shall do it
more easily by the length, than bredth; because, by the first way, the
continuity only of the *Parenchyma*, is dissolved; but by the latter,
both of this, and of the *Vessels*, these being posited by the length of the
*Root*: So that, as by the smalness of the *Bladders* of the *Parenchyma*,
the *Skin* is Dense; so by these *Vessels*, is it Tough.

5. §. Again, if you cut a *Root* traverse, and let it lie by for some
time, all the parts, where there are no *Vessels*, shrink below the surface of
the cut-end; but where-ever These are posited, there is no shrinking;
which oftentimes, evidently appears also in the *Skin*: because the said
*Vessels*, though, as the *Bladders*, they may coincide; yet they cannot
visibly shorten or shrink up in length; no more than a *Straw*, whose
sides may yet be easily crushed together.

6. §. Further, the *Root* being cut traverse, if, near the cut-end,
you very gently press the side of the *Root* with the edge of your Nail,
the *Sap* will thereupon arise sometimes from the *Skin*; in the same manner,
as from any other part of the *Root*, where the like *Vessels* are posited.
And although the *Sap* may likewise be expressed from the *Pith*,
and other *Parts* where sometimes, there are none of these *Vessels*; yet
not without a solution of there continuity; which here doth not follow;
as appears, from the disappearing of the *Sap*, together with the intermission

of the pressure; the said *Vessels* then dilating themselves by
a Motion of *Restitution*, and so sucking up the *Sap* again.

7. §. Hereunto may be added the Testimony of sight; the very
*Vessels* themselves, in many *Roots*, coming under an apparent view, and
standing in the utmost surface of the *Root* all round about, as in that
of Liquirish, Columbine, Scorzonera, and others. Which *Experiments*,
I have here, once for all, more particularly set down; because
I shall have occasion, hereafter, to refer to them.
