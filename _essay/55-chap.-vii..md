### CHAP. VII.

### Of the USE of the Parts to the Seed. And the TIME, in
    which the Uterus or Fruit and Seed-Case are formed.

![A](images/i_drop_a_182.jpg)
ND first, for example, in an *Apple*, the Five Inmost
*Branches*, do best serve for the *Generation* of
the *Seed*; these running into the *Attire* of the
*Flower*, and so carrying off the most *Aerial Spirit*
from the *Seed*; *P. 2. Ch. 5. §. 5.*
 by which means, it becomes a more
compact and denser *Body*, than the *Fruit*, and so
more accommodate to the process of *Vegetation*;
as hath formerly been shewed.

2. §. The *Elongation* likewise of the *Seed-Vessels*, in the *Fruit* and
*Case*, sometimes directly, as in *Plums* and *Nuts*, and sometimes by several
*Ambages* before they shoot into the *Seeds*, as in *Tulip*; shewes a
design for the highest refining and maturation of the *Seminal Sap*.

3. §. Chiefly by means of the Inmost *Vessels*, is made that *Chanel*
in some *Pears*, and especially in *Quinces*. For these perishing with
the *Flower*, the circumjacent *Parenchyma* shrinks up, leaving the said
*Chanel* in the midst. Designed for an inlet to the *Aer*, for the better
drying of the *Seeds*; which here stand the more in need of it, because
encompassed with a *Mucilage*.

4. §. For the better drying of the *Seed*, and the disbursing or
sowing of it in due time, the opening of the *Case* is, in the same manner,
also contrived: either at the *Top*, as in *Popy*; or on the *Sides*, as
in *Tulip*, *Pimpernel*; or at the *Bottom*, as in *Coded Arsmart*. All which
openings are effected by the running of the *Aer-Vessels* along those places:
for by drying the *Parenchyma* next adjacent, they cause it to chop
and cleave asunder.

5. §. Of the *Seed-Case* of *Poppy*, it is particularly to be noted,
That as the several *Windows*, serve to let in *Aer*, for the drying of the
*Seeds*, after their full Growth: So the *Canopy* over them, serves to
keep out *Rain*. For here, the *Case* not cleaving down the *Side*, as it
usually doth; should the *Rain* get in, it would stand in it, as in a *Pot*,
and so rot the *Seeds*. And as the *Canopy* serves to preserve the *Seeds*;
so the several *Partitions* or *Walls*, for their better *Stowage*. For by an
easie survey of this little piece of Ground, it is plain, that as they
stand on both *Sides* every *Wall*, there is as much more Ground for them
to stand upon, as if there were no parting *Walls*, but the *Seeds* stuck
all round about upon the *Ambit* or *Sides* of the *Case*; or upon a great
*Bed* or *Placenta* within it, as in *Hyoscyamus*, *Anagallis*, &c. where there
is a less numerous *Brood*.

6. §. The *Coar* likewise, by standing betwixt the moyst *Parenchyma*
and the *Seed*, and being hollow and so filled with *Aer*; doth much
conduce to the ripening and drying of the *Seed*, and its greater fitness
both for keeping, and sowing. So the *Parchment Lining* of the *Seed-Case*,
as in *Hyoscyamus*, &c. is answerable to a *Coar*.

7. §. The *Parenchyma* serveth, amongst other purposes, for the
*Generation* of the *Covers* of the *Seed*; as in some instances hath been
shewed. For which intent, sometimes the *Exterior Parenchyma*, as in
a *Limon*; sometimes the midlemost, as in a *Goosberry* or *Cucumer*, is
subservient; both of them, in those *Fruits*, being more white and dry,
than the rest, and so fiter to make the *Covers* of the *Seed*.

8. §. The *Parenchyma* is also of use for the warmth of the *Seed*;
as in the *Seed-Case* of *Garden Radish*. Wherein, as it ripens the *Parenchyma*
gradually drys, breaks, and shrinks up into several soft *Membranes*,
in which the *Seeds*, in the Centre of the *Case*, lie swadled, as in
so many fine *Calico Cloths*.

9. §. I SHALL conclude with observing the *Time* of the *Generation*
of the *Fruit* and *Seed-Case*. This hath hitherto been thought to be initiated
upon the opening, I say not, the forming, but the opening of the
*Flower*, or not long before. Notwithstanding which, what I have
formerly said of the *Flower*; I now do the like, of the *Uterus* it self;
*sc.* That in very many *Plants*, ’tis formed, with the *Flower*, the year
before it appears and comes to its full *Growth*. *Tab. 71.* As for instance, in *Azarum*,
not only all the *Parts* of the *Flower*, but the *Uterus* it self, and
there in also the outer *Cover* of the *Seed* of any one year, are perfectly
formed in *August* or *September* of the year foregoing. The like may
be seen in *Tulip*, *Mezereon*, *Corin*, and many other *Perennial Plants*.
