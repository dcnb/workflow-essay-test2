### CHAP. II.

### Wherein is shewed, That the said ESSENTIAL
and MARINE Salts of Plants are both of different
Sorts.

![H](images/i_drop_h_242.jpg)
AVING
made the Experiment, that both an
*Essential* and *Marine Salt* may be produced out
of the *Lixivial Salt* of a *Plant*. I thought it
probable, that neither the one nor the other,
was always the same, but that as they had their
general properties which made them to be of
two general kinds; so they might have some
special property, for the distinguishing of each
kind into several Sorts. And withall, that
in a warmer season, than before taken, the *Tryal* hereof might be
finished in a shorter time.

2. §. For the making of which, I conceived it requisite to remove
an Opinion which seemed to lye in my way; *sc.* That there is little
or no difference between the several *Lixivial Salts* of *Plants*, as some
Learned men have thought. But either there is a difference, or not: if
not, it should be proved: and if there be, it should then be justly stated,
what that difference is. For the doing of which, I chose this *Method*. I
took an equal quantity of the whitest and purest *Salts* of divers *Plants*,
all made by an equal degree of *Calcination*; and dissolved them all severally
in an equal quantity of water. And pouring likewise an equal
quantity, as about 10 or 12 drops of each into a spoon, I tasted them
severally. Whereby it was very evident, that they were not all of one
*Tast*, but of very different ones, both as to strength and kind: and
therefore different in Nature also. The *Salts* I made tryal of were
those of *Sorrel*, *Anise*, *Wormwood*, *Mallow*, *Ash*, *Tartar* and others:
and upon half a Drachm of each I poured ℥ijß of water. The *Solutions*
are here present to be tasted. By which the differences will easily
be observed, and particularly that the *Salt* of *Wormwood* or *Scurvygrass*,
is almost as strong again as the *Salt* of *Anise*, or *Sorrel*: and that
the *Salt* of *Ash* is above twice as strong, and that of *Tartar* above
thrice as strong, as that of *Sorrel*, and almost thrice as strong as that of
*Wormwood* or *Scurvygrass*. So that he who shall give half a Scruple,
suppose of *Salt* of *Tartar*; instead of half a Scruple of *Salt* of *Wormwood*,
or other like *Salt*; he may as well give a Scruple of *Rosin* of
*Jalap*, for a Scruple of the powder, or almost three Drachms of *Rhubarb*,
or other like *Purge*, instead of one. And the like is to be said
of other *Lixivial Salts* in their degrees.

3. §. Having observed thus much, I proceeded to repeat the former
Experiment, with some of the aforesaid, and some other *Vegetable
Salts*, the best calcin’d, and the purest, that could be made for this
purpose, being these Six *Salts*, *sc.* of *Rosemary*, *Garden Scurvygrass*,

*Black Thorn*, *Common Wormwood*, *Ash*, and *Tartar*. All which dissolved
severally in fair water, I exposed in a Chamber window, and
not in Winter, as before, but in the heat of Summer, *sc.* on the 19 of
*July*, to evaporate of themselves.

4. §. The Effect was, That the third day after their being exposed,
the *Essential Crystals* began to shoot in three of the *Solutions*,
*sc.* in that of *Rosemary*, of *Garden Scurvygrass*, and of *Black Thorn*.
On the fourth day, in that of *Wormwood*. On the fifth day, in that of
*Ash*. In that of *Tartar*, not at all.

5. §. These *Essential Crystals* began, in all, to shoot at the top, and
then to fall to the bottome; as in the Experiment before. But as there
was very little of the *white Sedement* before mentioned, that preceded;
So no *Scum* or *Cremor* at all. Which although a more perfect *Calcination*,
it seems, did here almost prevent; yet did not in the least destroy
the aforesaid *Essential Salt*, but rather make way for its more speedy and
copious *Production*: exhibiting likewise a distinct *Species* in several of
the *Solutions*.

6. §. For first, the *Crystals* of *Rosemary* (the largest of them)
were about the bigness of a *Rice-Corn*. In *Figure* almost like a *Tip-Cat*,
which Boys play with, split down the midle. Each *Tip* being cut into
5 sides all ending in a poynt: *Tab. 83.* the midle part divided into 7, all drawn
by parallel *Lines*; the topmost with the lowermost but one, on each
side, being three exact *Squares*.

7. §. The *Crystals* of *Black Thorn* are most of them poynted with
just six sides of Equal *Measure*: very like to the shooting of true
*Crystal* it self. *Tab. 83.* From the topmost of which six Sides, a *Line* being drawn
out, runs parallel to a broad *Base*, whereon each *Crystal* stands. So
that they are in some sort of a *Rhomboid Figure*.

8. §. The *Crystals* of *Scurvygrass* have also a very elegant and regular
*Figure*, which is in a manner compounded of the two former now
described. But they are nothing near so bigg, the largest of them,
being no biger than a *Grain* of that which we call *Pearl Barley*.

9. §. The *Crystals* of *Wormwood* have also very many of them a
regular *Figure*; but quite different from that of the *Crystals* before
mentioned; each *Crystal* being a little *Cylinder*, saving that it is constantly
somewhat smaller at one end, than the other: as it were one half
of a *Rowling-pin*. *Tab. 83.* And not evenly *Circular*, but cut out by Six *Sides*
of equal *Measure*: almost as in the *Crystal* of *Nitre*. So that contrary to
what is seen in the forementioned *Crystals*, the ends of these of
*Wormwood* are not poynted, but *flat*; and cut at *Right Angles* with
the *Sides*.

10. §. The *Crystals* of *Ash*, though by their properties they appear
likewise to be *Essential*; yet are nothing near so regularly figur’d, as
all the forementioned.

11. §. The *Colour* also of the said *Crystals* is somewhat different:
Those of *Ash* being of a *brown* transparency, almost like those of *Firne*.
Those of *Wormwood* being also *brownish*, but *paler*. Those of *Rosemary*
and *Scurvygrass* having some little *Tincture*, yet very *clear*. But
those of *Black Thorn* without the least *Tincture*, and as *clear* as *Crystal*
it self.

12. §. None of these *Essential Crystals* have any hot fiery *Taste*, but
are very *mild*, and sensibly *Bitter*; especially, about the *Root* of the
*Tongue*: as is also observable of some *Plants* hereafter mentioned, in
speaking of the different *Tastes* of *Plants*.

13. §. *Oyl* of *Vitriol* droped upon these *Crystals* doth not affect
them in the least: yet droped into the several *Solutions* out of which
the *Crystals* are produced, immediately causeth a great *Effervescence*.

14. §. Of the *Solutions* above named, that, of *Salt* of *Tartar* was
the 6ᵗʰ. Whereof it is remarquable, That having waited several
Months together, I could not observe the least *Essential Salt* to be
therein produced in all that time. Whether there be any other *Vegetable
Salts*, besides this of *Tartar*, which will not yield the *Essential*
above described, I have not yet experimented.

15. §. In the mean time, from the *Premises* it is very probable,
that most of them afford more or fewer of the said *Crystals*. In regard
they are *Plants* of a very different kind, which I made tryal upon:
as *Garden Scurvygrass*, very *Hot*; *Rosemary*, very *Aromatick*. *Wormwood*
very *Bitter*; *Black Thorn*, *Astringent* and *Sower*. And it is also
plain, That the said *Essential Salts* contained in the *Lixivial*, are not
altogether one and the same, but of divers Sorts.

16. §. ABOUT 7 or 8 days after the *Essential Crystals* were produced;
the *Marine Salt* did also begin to shoot; first in *Rosemary*; quickly
after, in *Scurvygrass*; Next, in *Black Thorn* and *Wormwood*, *sc.* after
the space of a week or 10 days more. And in all of them with some
difference of *Size* and *Figure*.

17. §. The plainest of all, was that produced out of the *Salt* of
*Black Thorn*, consisting for the most part of very small *Crystals*, not
above the 15ᵗʰ of an Inch square, as also *thin*, shaped like a *Duch Tile*
used for *Chimnies*. Many others were very *thick*, and near to a
*Cube*. *Tab. 83.* Most of which were a little hollowed in the midle, like a grinding
*Marble* or *Salt-Celler*; and the hollow bounded by 4 plain and
equal *Sides*, all descending a little towards the *Centre*; and measured
by two cross *Lines*, which staid upon the four *Angles* of the *Square*,
and so cut one the other at *Right Angles*. Both which *Properties*
are likewise usually seen in the *Crystals* of *Common Salt*.

18. §. In *Wormwood*, many of these *Crystals*, besides the plain
ones, were figur’d crossways like a *Dagger-Hilt*. *Tab. 83.* Which was sometimes
naked, and sometimes inclosed in a square and almost *Cubical Box*.
Many others were figur’d into *Sprigs* made up of four chief *Branches*
standing crosswise, and those *subbranched*; and all the *Branches* made
up of little square *Crystals*, clustered together in that *Figure*. The
*Sprigy Figure* of these *Crystals* is not accidental, but hath constantly
come after they had been three times dissolved, and the *Solution* exposed
to evaporate.

19. §. The *Marine Salt* of *Rosemary* hath also some variety. For
besides the plain ones above described, there are some thick *Squares*,
*Tab. 83.* which have also a square hollow descending by five, six, or seven narrow
steps, towards the *Centre*; being in *Figure*, saving these *Steps*,
somewhat like the *Hoper* in a *Mill*.

20. §. Upon a second *Solution* of the same *Salt*, there shoots another
sort of square; which is not plain on the edges, as the above-named,
*Tab. 83.* but scalloped or florid all round about, not unlike the *Leaves*
of some *Plants*.

21. §. The *Crystals* of *Marine Salt* of *Scurvygrass* are somewhat
like to those of *Rosemary* now described.

22. §. As for the *Lixivial Salts* of *Ash* and *Tartar*, though in a
Month or Five Weeks Space, they yield some *Crystals* of very clear
*Salt*: yet of *Marine Salt* neither of them yieldeth the least particle.
So that of these Six *Lixivial Salts*, *sc.* of *Rosemary*, *Scurvygrass*, *Black
Thorn*, *Wormwood*, *Ash* and *Tartar*, all, but that of *Tartar*, yielded an
*Essential Salt*. And all, but those of *Ash* and *Tartar*, yielded a *Marine*,
such as is above described. All which *Salts* both *Essential* and
*Marine*, together with their *Models*, made of *white Alabastre*, I have
here ready to be seen.

23. §. Of those that yield these *Salts*, or either of them, it is
further to be noted, That there is a considerable difference in the
*Proportion* or *Quantities* which they yield. The *Rosemary* yields store
both of *Essential* and *Marine*, but more *Essential*. *Wormwood* and *Scurvygrass*
more *Marine*. *Black Thorn* less of Either. The *Ash* no
*Marine*, and the *Tartar* neither the *Essential* nor *Marine*, as hath
been said.

24. §. From what hath been said, I deduce only at present these
Three *Corollaies*. *First*, That a *Lixivial Salt*, is not only a compounded
Body *sc.* of *Salt*, *Sulphur*, *Aer* and *Earth*; but even a *Compounded
Salt*, containing both a *Vegetable Nitre*, and a true *Sea Salt*.

25. §. *Secondly*, That the *Exposing* of *Bodies*, in the manner
above shewed, may justly be accounted one *Part* of *Chymistry* hitherto
*Deficient*, and much farther to be improved for the *Discovery* of the *Nature*
of *Bodies*. For as *Nature* chiefly compoundeth *Bodies* by *Digesting*
them, and so either shutting out or keeping in the *Aer*: So she *Dissolveth*
them by *Exposing*, and so neither shutting in the *Aer*, nor keeping
it out, but leaving it free to come and go; and thereby to bring,
and carry off whatsoever is necessary for the *Separation* or *Solution* of
*Bodies*. For the *Sea* it self (to confine the similitude to our present case)
is but as a *Great Pan*, wherein all kinds of bodies being long exposed,
are throughly resolved, ultimately yielding from the rest of their *visible
Principles*, that which we call *Sea Salt*.

26. §. *Lastly*, if by *Exposing* and *Dissolving* we can make one *Salt*;
then by *Compounding* and *Digesting* we may make another, yea any
other *Salt*; either a *Fixed* of a *Volatile*, or a *Volatile* of a *Fixed*. That
is to say, a *Volatile Salt* may be so separated from other *Bodies*, as to become
*Fixed*; or a *Fixed Salt* may be so *mixed* with other *Bodies* as to
become *Volatile*. For that any *Salt* should of it self become *Fixed* or
*Volatile*, is a *Fixion* not grounded upon *Experiment*.

27. §. As for the *Virtue* of the *Essential Salts* above described, I
believe they will be found upon tryal, not contemptible in some
Cases. For which amongst other reasons, I have been the more punctual

in relating the manner of their *Generation*; that others also may have
the opportunity of making proof hereof.

28. §. When I made the *Experiments* for this and the foregoing
*Discourse*, not having so good conveniency at home for making the
*Salts* I used: I procured them all (except that of *Firne*, which I made
my self) to be purposely prepared by Mr. *John Blackstone* a *London
Apothecary*, who assured me of his great care herein; and particularly,
that he added no *Nitre* to whiten any of the *Salts* with, as is commonly
done for that of *Tartar*.

I do declare, That all the *Lixivial Salts*
mentioned in this and the foregoing *Discourse*
except that of *Firne*, were faithfully prepared
by me

*John Blackstone.*
