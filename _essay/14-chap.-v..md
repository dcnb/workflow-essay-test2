### CHAP. V.

### Of the PITH.

![W](images/i_drop_w_075.jpg)
ITHIN
 the *Lignous Part* lyeth the
*Pith*. This *Part* is not common to all *Roots*,
for some have none, as *Nicotian*, *Stramonium*, and
others. Yet many which have none, or but little, throughout all
their lower parts, have one fair enough about their tops, as
*Mallow*, *Bourage*, *Dandelion*, and the like. *Tab. 6.* See the *Roots*. And
in many others there are *Parenchymous Parts*, of the same
substantial nature with the *Pith*, distributed betwixt the
several Rings of *Vessels*, and every where visible, from the
top to the bottom, as in *Beet*, *Fenil*, &c.
 *Tab. 8.*

2. §. The Size of the *Pith* is varied
by many Degrees, easily reckoned an Hundred; in *Fenil*,
*Dandelion*, *Asparagus*, but small; in *Horse-Radish*,
*Valerian*, *Bistort*, great. The Shape hereof, in the lower
parts of most *Roots*, is Pyramidal; but at the tops, Various,
according to the different Distribution of the *Vessels*, as in
*Carrot*, *Hyperbolick*, in *Parsley*, *Oval*;
*Tab. 6.* as appeareth, in cutting
the *Roots* length-ways.

3. §. The *Pith*, for the most part, especially in *Trees*, is a *Simple* Body:
but sometimes, it is, as the *Barque*, compounded; some certain number
of *Succiferous Vessels* being mixed herewith; as in *Jerusalem Artichoke*,
 *Tab. 6, & 8.*
*Horse-Radish*, &c. upon a traverse cut, by a strict view, may be
discerned. Their Position is sometimes Confused, as in a *Carrot*; and
sometimes Regular, as in *Parsley*; appearing, by the traverse cut, in
Rings, and in cutting by the length, in Arches.
 *Tab. 6.*
 And sometimes the
*Pith* is hollow; as in the *Level-Roots* of *Bishops-Weed*: these *Roots*
being made out of the *Stalk*, *§. 13, 14, 15.* as in the *First* **Chapter** hath been shewed,
how.

4. §. As all the other Parts of the *Root*, are originated from the
*Seed*; so, sometimes, is the *Pith* it self. But sometimes, it hath its
more immediate Derivation from the *Barque*. Hence it is, that many
*Roots*, which have no *Pith* in their lower parts, have one at their
top, as *Columbine*, *Lovage*, &c. *Tab. 4.* For the *Parenchymous Parts* of the
*Barque* being, by degrees, distributed into Diametral *Portions*, running
betwixt those of the *Lignous Body*, and at length, meeting and
uniting in the Centre, they thus constitute the *Pith*. In the same
manner, at the top of some *Roots*, the *Pith* is either made or augmented,
out of the *Parenchymous Rings* above described; these being
gradually distributed to, and embodied in the Centre; as in *Fenil*, and
some other *Roots*, their lower and upper parts compared together,
maybe seen. Even as in *Animals*, one *Part*, as the *Dura Mater*, is
the original of divers others.

5. §. From hence, it also appears, That the *Pith* is of the same
Substantial Nature with the *Parenchyma* of the *Barque*, and with the
Diametral *Portions*; and that therefore they are all one body, differing
in no Essential Property, but only in their Shape and Place. The
same is also evident from the Continuity of the *Pith* with the Diametral
*Portions*, as of These, with the said *Parenchyma*. And from
their Contexture, which, by a *Microscope*, appeareth to be of one
and the same general kind, in all *Plants*, both in the *Parenchyma* of
the *Barque*, in the *Insertment* or Diametral *Portions*, and in the *Pith*,
all being made up of *Bladders*.

*Tab. 9, & 15.*
 6. §. The *Bladders* of the *Pith*, are of very different Sizes; seldom
less, than in the *Barque*, as in *Asparagus*; usually much bigger,
as in *Horse-Radish*. They may be well reckoned to about fifteen or
twenty degrees; those in *Jerusalem Artichoke*, of the largest; in *Valerian*,
*Horse-Radish*, of the meaner; in *Bistort*, *Peony*, of the smallest.
Their Position is rarely varied, as it is oftentimes, in the *Barque*;
but more uniform, and in the transverse Cut, equally respective to all
parts of the *Root*: yet being piled evenly, one over another, in the
long cut, they seem to run, in Direct Trains, by the length of the
*Root*. Their Shape also is, usually more orbicular;
 *Tab. 11.*
 but sometimes,
somewhat angular, in the larger kinds, as in *Jerusalem Artichoke*.

7. §. THUS FAR the Contexture of the *Pith* is well discoverable
in the *Root*. In the *Trunk*, farther, and more easily. Whereof
therefore, in the next *Book*, I shall give a more particular *Description*
and *Draught*. Yet since I am speaking of it, I shall not wholly omit
here to observe, That the *Sides*, by which the aforesaid *Bladders* of
the *Pith* are circumscribed, are not meer *Paper-Skins*, or rude *Membranes*;
but so many several Ranks or Piles of exceeding small *Fibrous
Threds*; lying, for the most part, evenly one over another,
from the bottom to the top of every *Bladder*; and running cross,
as the *Threds* in the Weavers *Warp*, from one *Bladder* to another.
Which is to say, That the *Pith* is nothing else but a *Rete mirabile*, or
an Infinite Number of *Fibres* exquisitely small, and admirably Complicated
together: as by cutting the *Pith* with a *Razor*, and so viewing
it with a good *Glass*, may be seen. See the *Figures* belonging to
the *Third* **Book**.

8. §. All *Plants* exhibit this Spectable, not alike distinctly; those
best, with the largest *Bladders*. Nor the same *Pith*, in any condition;
but best, when dry: Because then, the *Sap* being voided, the spaces
betwixt the *Fibrous Threds*, and so the *Threds* themselves, are more distinctly
discernable. Yet is it not to be dryed, after Cutting; Because
its several parts, will thereupon coincide and become deformed. But to
be chosen, while the *Plant* is yet growing; at which time, it may be
often found dry, yet undeformed; as in the *Trunks* of *Common Thistle*,
*Jerusalem Artichoke*, &c.

9. §. Neither are these *Threds*, so far as I can observe, Single *Fibres*;
but usually, consist of several together. Nor are they *simply*
Collateral, but by the weftage of other *Fibres*, in their natural Estate,
knit together; much after the same manner as the *Spiral Fibres* of the

*Aer-Vessels*. This Connexion I have no where so well seen, as in the
White *Bottoms* of the *Bladders* of a *Bulrush*, being cut traverse; wherein
they have the appearance, of very Fine and close *Needle-work*.

10. §. The *Fibres* by which the said *Threds* are knit together, I
think are all Single: and are seldom and scarcely visible, except by
obliquely Tearing the *Pith*; by which means, they will appear through
the Glass, broken off, sometimes, a quarter or half an Inch, or an
Inch in Length; and as small as one Single *Thred* of a *Spiders Webb*.
In a *Bulrush*, they are sometimes discernable in cutting by the Length.
These *Fibres*, and the *Threds*, they knit together, for the most part,
are so pellucid, and closely situate, that they frequently seem to
make One entire Body, as a piece of *Ice* or a film of *Water* it
self: or even as *Animal Skins* sometimes shew, which yet are known
to be *Fibrous*.

11. §. The Situation of these *Threds*, is contrary to that of the
*Vessels*, as those by the Length, so these, chiefly, by the Bredth of the
*Root*, or horizontally, from one edge of the *Pith* to the other. They are
continued circularly; whereby, as oft as they keep within the compass
of the several *Bladders*, the said *Bladders* are Round: But where they
winde out of one *Bladder*, into another, they mutually Intersect a *Chord*
of their several *Circles*; by which means, the *Bladders* become Angular.

12. §. The Contexture, likewise, both of the *Parenchymous Part*
of the *Barque*, and of the Diametral *Portions* inserted betwixt the *Lignous*;
is the same with this of the *Pith*, now described; that is, *Fibrous*.
Whence we understand, How the several *Braces* and *Threds* of the *Vessels*
are made: For the *Vessels* running by the length of the *Root*, as the
*Warp*; by the *Parenchymous Fibres* running cross or horizontally, as
the *Woof*: they are thus *knit* and as it were *stitched* up together.
Yet their *weftage* seemeth not to be *simple*, as in Cloath; but that
many of the *Parenchymous Fibres* are *wraped* round about each
*Vessel*; and, in the same manner, are continued from one *Vessel* to
another; thereby knitting them altogether, more closely, into one
*Tubulary Thred*; and those *Threds*, again, into one *Brace*: much after
the manner of the *Needle work* called *Back-Stitch* or that used in
Quilting of Balls. Some obscure sight hereof, may be taken in a *Thred*
of *Cambrick*, through a *Microscope*. But it is most visible, in the *Leaves*
and *Flowers* of some *Plants*. The Delineation of these Things I shall
therefore omit, till we come hereafter to speak of the other *Parts*.

13. §. From what hath been said, it may be conjectured; That
the *Aer Vessels* successively appearing in the *Barque*, are formed, not
out of any *Fluid Matter*, as are the original ones: But of the *Parenchymous
Fibres*; *sc.* by changing them from a *Spherical* to a *Tubulary
Forme*.

14. §. From the precedents, it is also manifest, That all the *Parenchymous
Parts* of a *Root*, are *Fibrous*.

15. §. And lastly, That the whole Body of a *Root*, consisteth of
*Vessels* and *Fibres*. And, That these *Fibres* themselves, are Tubulous,

or so many more *Vessels*, is most probable: There only wanteth a greater
perfection of *Microscopes* to determine.

16. §. The *Contents* of the *Pith* are, sometimes *Liquor*, and sometimes
a *Vaporous-Aer*. The *Liquor* is always Diaphanous, as that of the
*Parenchymous Part* of the *Barque*; and in nature, not much differing
from it. The *Aer* is sometimes less, and sometimes more *Vaporous*, than
that of the *Barque*. By this *Aer* I mean, that which is contained in the
*Bladders*. Within the Concaves of the *Fibres* which compose the *Bladders*,
I suppose, there is another different Sort of *Aer*. So that as in
the *Bladders* is contained a more *Aqueous*; and in the *Vessels*, a more
*Essential Liquor*: So sometimes, in the same *Bladders*, is contained a
more *Vaporous*; and in the *Fibres*, a more Simple and *Essential Aer*.
