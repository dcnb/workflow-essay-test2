*Tab. 54.*HE *Leaves* of the *Flower* are folded up in such
Sort, as is most agreeable to their own *Shape*, and
that of their inclosed *Attire*: *Ch. 5.* whereof I have
given Instances in the *First* **Book**. I shall here
add some further *Remarques*.

2. §. The *Leaves* of the *Flower* of *Blattaria*,
although of different *Size* and *Shape*; *Tab. 54.* are
so lapped one over another, as to make an
*Equilateral Pentangle*.

3. §. The *Spiral Fold*, which is proper to the *Flower*, and never
seen in the *Green Leaves*; *Tab. 54.* as it is it self immediately visible on the *Surface*,
so by cutting off the top of the *Flower* before it is expanded,
seems also to make a *Helix*; as in *Perwincle*, the larger *Convolvulus*, &c.

4. §. In some *Flowers*, where the *Attire* is lofty or spreading, as in
*Holioak*, together with the *Spiral Fold*, the *Leaves* are all at the top
tacked down a little; thereby making a blunter *Cone*, and so a more
ample *Pyramid* for the inclosed *Attire*.

5. §. In *Poppy*, although the *Leaves* are extraordinary broad, yet
being but few, and inclosing a small *Attire*; they could not be well reduced
to any regular *Fold*, *Tab. 54.* without leaving such a *Vacuity*, as by being
filled with *Aer*, might be prejudicial to the *Seed*. For which reason,
they are cramb’d up within the *Empalement* by hundreds of little
*Wrinckles* or *Puckers*; as if Three or Four fine *Cambrick Handcherchiefs*
were thrust into ones *Pocket*.

6. §. In *Ladies-Bower*, the *Leaves* are neither laped one over another,
as is most usual, nor set Edge to Edge, as sometimes, but Side
to Side, *Tab. 54.* answerable to their *Shape*, and the *Distribution* of their *Fibres*.
Their broad *Tops* being also rowled up so as to make a *Cone*.
In *Ladys-Looking-Glass*, they stand also Side to Side, but in a different
manner: in the Former with the Sides standing inward, but here,
bearing outward.

7. §. In the *Marvel* of *Peru*, the *Fold* is likewise very peculiar.
For, besides the several *Plates*, about Six, *Tab. 54.* whereby the *Flower* is gathered
in the Midle; the *Top* of it is also gathered up by as many distinct
*Plates*, underneath the former; and these *rowled* or *wreathed* up
together so exactly, that the like could hardly be imitated by a very
*dextrous Hand*.

8. §. OF the *Hairs* upon *Flowers* and their *Use* to the *Attire*, I
have also spoken in the *First* **Book**.*Ch. 5.* I shall here add, That they are
likewise of *Use* to the *Leaves* themselves, that is, for their closer and
faster *Conjunction*. For of some *Flowers* it is observable, That they
are all over *smooth*, saving on their Edges, which are border’d with
*Fringes* of *Hair*; as of *Spanish Broome*, *Dulcamara*, and others: *Tab. 55.* In
which, the *Hairs* on the Edge of one *Leaf*, are so complicated, or at
least indented, with those of another, that all the *Leaves* seem to be
but one piece. *Nature* seeing it fit, by this means to tie them together,
lest they should be expanded before it be due time.

9. §. Many *Flowers* instead of *Hairs*, are beset round about, with
a great Number of small *Parts*, not ending in a *Poynt*, but having a
*Head*. Sometimes oval, as in *Snap-Dragon*, like the *Horns* of a *Butterfly*,
or a *Plummers Sodering-Iron*. But usually *Globular*, as in *Deadly
Nightshade*, like so many little *Mushrooms* sprouting out of the
*Flower*.

10. §. Out of these *Heads*, doth sometimes issue a *Gummy* or *Balsamick
Juyce*. From whence proceeds that *Clamminess* of some *Flowers*,
whereby, being handled they stick to our *Fingers*, as do those of *Blattaria*,
and of *Marigold*; and those of *Colus Jovis*, where the said *Heads*
are so *soft* and *succulent*, that they resemble so many little *Drops* of
*Balsame*. The *Clamminess* which is felt upon fresh *Carduus*, may perhaps
proceed from the like *Cause*.

11. §. THE *Number* of the *Leaves* of the *Flower* hath been noted
by the Learned Sir *Thomas Brown*, Treat. of the *Quinc*. to be usually *Five*. And this
Nature so far affecteth, that many times where the *Leaves* of the same
*Flower* are of a different *Size*, yet they keep to this *Number*, *Tab. 54.*
 as in *Blattaria*.

12. §. I also add, That even those *Flowers*, which are not properly
parted into *Leaves*, have yet their *Tops* usually divided into *Five*
great *Scallops*; as those of *Toad-Flax*, *Snap-Dragon*, *Coded-Arsmart*,
*Clary*, *Broom*, and others. And when the *Flower* hath more than *Five*,
even many times *Five Leaves*; yet the *Top* of each *Leaf* is indented into
*Five Parts*; *Tab. 54.* as in *Scorzonera*, *Cichory*, and all the *Intybous* Kind, with
many others.

13. §. From whence and other like *Instances*, it may seem, That
there is some certain *Species* of *Salt* in *Nature*, and that in most *Plants*,
of whose *Agency* there are still some *Footsteps* or other in the
*Flower*.

14. §. The *Number* of the *Leaves*, as hath been said, is commonly
*Five*. Yet some *Flowers* have fewer, and some more, and that with
Constancy, in divers *Numbers*, from *One* to *One* and *Twenty*; perhaps
in all, so far. The *Flower* of *Acanthus Syriacus*, is in a manner one
single *Leaf*, that of *Monks-Rubarb*, *Three-Leav’d*; of *Poppy*, *Crosswort*,
*Radish*, and many others, *Four-Leav’d*; the greater *Number* of
*Flowers*, *Five-Leav’d*; of *White Hellebore*, *Tulip*, *Onion*, and most
*Plants* with *Bulbous Roots*, *Six-Leav’d*; of *Wild-Crowfoot*, *Seven-Leav’d*;
of *French Marigold*, commonly *Eight-Leav’d*; of *Flower-de-luce*,
*Nine-Leav’d*; of *Chickweed*, *Ladies-Mantle*, *Ten-Leav’d*; of *St.
James’s Wort*, *Thirteen-Leav’d*; and I think of *Febrifuga*, *Cotula*, *Ageratum*,
*Corn-Marigold*, with others; and of *Chamemile*, *Buphthalmum*,
and some few more, the *Leaves* are commonly *One* and *Twenty*.
In that of St. *James’s Wort*, the *Number* is so constant that there is
scarce *One Flower* in *Forty*, wherein the *Leaves* are more or fewer than
*Thirteen*. *Tab. 55.* Divers of which *Numbers*, seem also to have some relation to
the *Number* 5. For 9, is Twice; 13, Thrice; and 25, Five times 5 running
into it self.

15. §. THE *Constituent Parts* of the *Flower* are the same as those
of the *Leaf*, *sc.* the *Parenchyma* or *Pulp*, and the *Vessels*. But in the *Basis*
or bottom of the *Flower*, the *Parenchyma* is commonly much more *spongy*
and *dry*, than in the *Leaves*; conteining, after the *Flower* is open’d,
little or no *Sap*, but only a dry and warm *Aer*. Which standing continually
under the *Seed*, hastens the *Maturation* or due *Exiccation* thereof:
as we use to dry *Maulted Barly* over a warm *Killn*.

16. §. The *Vessels* of the *Flower*, are both for *Sap* and for *Aer*, as
well as in other *Parts*. And both of them sometimes, even in the *Skin*
of the *Flower*; as may be argued from its being stained with divers
*Colours*; produced as hath formerly been shewed, by the mixed
*Tinctures* of the said *Vessels*.
 *B. 2. P. 2. §. 65, 66, 67.* These *Colours*, in many *Flowers*, as *Tulips*,
as they are in the *Skin* it self, so therein only; the *Pulp* of the
*Leaf* being white.

17. §. The *Lignous* or *Sap-Vessels* are fewer, and the *Aer-Vessels* smaller
in the *Flower*, than in the *Leaf*. And therefore it is very difficult
to observe the latter by *Glasses*; especially the *Proportion* which they
hold to the other *Parts*. But if you break the *Leaves* of some *Flowers*,
with very great gentleness; they may hereby be *Unroaved* or *drawn
out*, as in the *Green Leaves*, to some visible length; and their different
*Number* in divers *Flowers* may be discerned.

18. §. THE *Use* of the *Flower* or of the *Foliature* whereof we
are speaking, is various; *B. 1. Ch. 5.* as hath formerly been shewed. I now only
add, That one *Use* hereof seemeth to be, for the *Separation* of the
more *Volatile* and stronger *Sulphur* of the *Plant*. That so the *Seed*,
which lyeth within or next it, may be so much the milder, and the *Principles*
thereof more fixed and concentred. And this, both for its better
*Duration* till the time of *Sowing*; and also, that its *Fermentation*,
when it is sow’n, may not be too hot and precipitate; but suitable to
so slow and equal a motion, as is the *Vegetation* of a *Seed*.

19. §. And that this *Sulphur* is separated and discharged by the
*Flower*, seems evident, not only from the *Strength* of its *Odour*, above
that of the other *Parts*; but likewise, in that many times where there
is no *Flower*, or that very small, the *Seed*, that is its *Cover*, as in the *Umbelliferous

Kind*, is the more odorous. And therefore also, the *Vine*
hath no *Flower*, partly, that the most *Volatile Spirit* and *Sulphur* might
all run into the *Fruit*.

20. §. THE *Figure* of the *Flower*, although it is often much more
complex, than that of the *Leaf*: yet there is no doubt, but that the
*Measure* hereof may be defined in some way, answerable to that exemplified
in the foregoing **Part**. The difference is only this, That
whereas the *Green Leaves*, and the Plain *Leaves* also of the *Flower*, are
all measured by the *parts* of several *Circles*: those *Flowers* which
are *Bellyed*, and those *Leaves* of the *Flower* which are not *Plain*,
but *Convex*, are all measured by the *parts* of several *Spheres*. And as
the *Diametres* of those *Circles*, bear a certain proportion to the midle
*Stemm* of the *Leaf*; so the *Axes* of these *Spheres*, to an imaginary
one in the *Centre* of the *Flower*.

21 §. NOW the reason why the *Figure* of the *Flower* is more
*multiplex*, than that of the *Leaf*; may be, *partly*, because it is under
the Command and Government of those *Salts*, which are here more
*refined* and *depurate*, than in the *Leaf*; and so more free to lay the Foundation
of any kind of *Figure*, for which, of their own *Nature*, they are
adapted. *Partly*, for that as the *Nitrous* and *Alkaline Salts* are chiefly
regnant in the *Leaf*; so in the *Flower*, in which the *Parenchymous Part*
hath a greater⁠[66] proportion than in the *Leaf*; it is most reasonable,
to assign the *Predominion* to the *Acid*⁠[67]: the *Particles* whereof, both as
they are less, and also poynted at both ends,⁠[68] seem to be more easily
applicable one to another for the making of any Sort of *Line* or *Figure*.
