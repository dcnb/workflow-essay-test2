### Of the GERMEN, BRANCH, and LEAF.

![T](images/i_drop_t_148.jpg)
HE
 Parts of the *Germen* and *Branch*, are the
same with those of the *Trunk*; the same *Skin*,
*Cortical* and *Lignous Bodies*, *Insertment* and *Pith*,
hereinto propagated, and distinctly observable
herein.

2. §. For upon Enquiry into the Original
of a *Branch* or *Germen*, it appears, That it
is not from the *Superficies* of the *Trunk*; but
so deep, as to take, with the *Cortical*, the
*Lignous Body* into it self: and that, not only from its Circumference,
but from its *Inner* or *Central Parts*; So as to take the *Pith* in
also. Divers of which *Parts* may commonly be seen to shoot out
into the *Pith*; from which *Shoots*, the surrounding and more superiour
*Germens* are originated; in like manner as the Succulent Part of
the *Lignous Body* of the *Trunk* is sometimes principally from those Fibrous
*Shoots* which run along the *Pith* in the *Root*.

3. §. The manner wherein usually the *Germen* and *Branch* are fram’d,
is briefly thus: The *Sap* (as is said, *Chap. 3.*) mounting in the *Trunk*,
will not only by its length, but by its breadth also, through the *Insertions*
partly move. Yet, its Particles being not all alike qualified, in different
degrees. Some are more gross and sluggish; of which we have the
formation of a Circle of Wood only, or of an *Annual Ring*. Others are
more brisk; and by these, we have the *Germen* propagated. For by
the vigour of their own motion from the Center, they impress an equal
tendency on some of the inner *Portions* of the *Lignous Body* next adjacent

to the *Pith*, to move with them. And since the *Lignous Body* is
not entire, but frequently disparted; through these *Dispartments*, the
said interiour *Portions*, upon their Nutrition, actually shoot; not
only towards the Circumference, so as to make part of a *Ring*; but even
beyond it, in order to the production of a *Germen*. And the *Lignous
Body* thus moving, and carrying the *Cortical* along with it; they both
make a force upon the *Skin*. Yet their motion being most even and gradual,
that force is such likewise; not to cause the least breach of its
parts, but gently to carry it on with themselves; and so partly, by
the extension of its already existent parts, as of those of *Gold* in drawing
of Guilded *Wyer*; and partly, by the accretion of new ones, as in
the enlarging of a *Bubble* above the Surface of the Water; it is extended
with them to their utmost growth. In which growth, the
*Germen* being prolonged, and so displaying its several parts, as when
a *Prospective* or *Telescope* is drawn out, thus becomes a *Branch*.

4. §. The same way as the propagation of the *Parts* of a *Germen* is
contriv’d, is its due nutrition also. For being originated from the
inner part of the *Lignous Body*, ’tis nourished with the best fermented
*Sap* in the *Trunk*, *sc.* that next adjacent to it in the *Pith*. Besides,
since all its *Parts*, upon their shooting forth, divaricate from their perpendicular,
to a cross Line, as these and the other grow and thrive
together, they bind and throng each other into a *Knot*: through
which *Knot* the *Sap* being strain’d, ’tis thus, in due moderation and
purity delivered up into the *Branch*.

5. §. And for *Knots*, they are so necessary, as to be seen not
only where collateral *Branches* put forth; but in such *Plants* also, as
shoot up in one single *Trunk*; as in *Corn*. Wherein, as they make
for the strength of the *Trunk*; so by so many percolations, as they
are *Knots*, for the transmission of the *Sap* more and more refined
towards the *Ear*. So that the two general uses of *Knots* are, For
*firmer standing*, and *finer growth*.

6. §. Lastly, as the due Formation and Nutrition of the *Germen*
are provided for, so is its security also; which both in its position upon
the *Trunk*, and that of its *Parts* among themselves, may be observed.
The position of its *Parts* shall be considered in speaking of the
*Leaf*. As to its standing in the *Trunk*, ’tis alwayes betwixt the
*trunk* or *older Branch*, and the *Basis* of the Stalk of a *Leaf*; whereby
it is not only guarded from the Injuries of any contingent Violence;
but also from the more piercing assaults of the Cold; so
long, till in time ’tis grown larger, and more hardy. The manner
and uses of the position of every *Germen*, considered as after it becomes
a *Branch*; hath already been, Hist. of the *Prop.* of *Veget.* by the Ingenious Mr. *Sharrock*
very well observed; to whom I refer.

7. §. UPON THE prolongation of the *Germen* into a *Branch*, its
*Leaves* are thus display’d. The *Parts* whereof are substantially the
same with those of a *Branch*. For the *Skin* of the *Leaf*, is only the
ampliation of that of the *Branch*; being partly by the accretion of
new, and partly the extention of its already existent parts, dilated
(as in making of *Leaf-Gold*) into its present breadth. The *Fibres* or
*Nerves* dispersed through the *Leaf*, are only the Ramifications of the
*Branch’s* Wood, or *Lignous Body*. The *Parenchyma* of the *Leaf*,

which lies betwixt the *Nerves*, and as in Gentlewomens Needle-works,
fills all up, is nothing else, but the continuation of the *Cortical Body*,
or *Parenchymous* part of the *Barque* from the *Branch* into it self, as in
most *Plants* with a thick *Leaf*, may easily be seen.

8. §. The *Fibers* of the *Leaf* neither shoot out of the *Branch*, or
the *Trunk*, nor stand in the *Stalk*, in an *even* Line; but alwayes in
either an *Angular* or *Circular* posture; and usually making either a
*Triangle*, or a *Semi-Circle*, or *Chord* of a Circle; as in *Cichory*, *Endive*,
*Cabbage*, &c. may be observed. *Tab. 4. f. 2.* to *f. 11.* And if the *Leaf* have but one main *Fiber*,
that also is postur’d in a bowed or *Lunar* Figure; as in *Mint* and
others. The usual number of these *Vascular Threds* or *Fibres* is 3, 5, or 7.

9. §. The reason of the said Positions of the *Fibers* in the *Stalk* of
the *Leaf*, is for its more *Erect* growth, and greater *Strength*: which,
were the position of the said *Fibers* in an *even Line*, and so the *Stalk*
it self as well as the *Leaf*, flat; must needs have been defective; as
from what we have said of the Circumferential posture of the *Lignous
Body* in the *Trunk*, *C. 3. §. 24.* we may better conceive.

10. §. As likewise for the security of its *Sap*: For by this means
it is, that the several *Fibers*, and especially the main or middle *Fiber*
of the *Leaf*, together with a considerable part of the *Parenchyma*, are
so disposed of, as to jut out, not from its upper, but its back, or
nether Side. Whence the whole *Leaf*, reclining backward, becomes
a Canopy to them, defending them from those Injuries which from
colder Blasts, or an hotter Sun, they might otherwise sustain. So
that by a mutual benefit, as These give *suck* to all the *Leaf*, so that
again *protection* to These.

11. §. These *Fibers* are likewise the immediate Visible Cause of the
Shape of the *Leaf*. For if the nethermost *Fiber* or *Fibers* in the *Stalk*
(which thence runs chiefly through the length of the *Leaf*) be in proportion
greater, the *Leaf* is long; as in *Endive*, *Cichory*, and others:
If all of a more equal size, it spreads rounder, as in *Ivy*, *Doves-foot*,
*Colts foot*, &c. And although a *Dock-Leaf* be very long, whose
*Fibers* notwithstanding, as they stand higher in the *Stalk*, are disposed
into a *Circle* all of an equal size; yet herein one or more peculiar
*Fibres*, *Tab. 4.* standing, in or near the *Center*, betwixt the rest, and running
through the length of the *Leaf*, may be observed.

12. §. In correspondence also to the size and shape of these *Fibres*,
is the *Leaf* flat. In that either they are very small, or if larger, yet
they never make an entire Circle or *Ring*; but either half of one, as
in *Borage*, or at most three parts of one, as in *Mullen*, may be seen.
*Tab. 4.* For if either they were so big, as to contain, or so entire, as perfectly
to include a *Pith*, the Energy of the *Sap* in that *Pith*, would cause
the said *Lignous Ring* to shoot forth on every side, as it doth in the
*Root* or *Trunk*: But the said *Fibers* being not figur’d into an entire
*Ring*, but so as to be open; on that hand therefore where open
they cannot shoot any thing directly from themselves, because there
they have nothing to shoot; and the *Sap* having also a free vent
through the said opening, against that part therefore which is thereunto
opposite, it can have no force; and so neither will they shoot
forth on that hand; and so will they consequently, that way only,
which the force of the *Sap* directs, which is only on the right and
left.

13. §. The several *Fibers* in the *Stalk*, are all Inosculated in the
*Leaf*, with very many Sub-divisions. According as these *Fibers* are
Inosculated near, or at, or shoot directly to the edge of the *Leaf*,
is it Even, or Scallop’d. Where these *Inosculations* are not made,
there we have no *Leaves*, but only a company of *Filaments*; as in
*Fennel*.

14. §. To the *Formations* of *Leaves*, the *Fouldings* immediately
follow. And sometimes they have one Date, or are the contemporary
works of *Nature*; each *Leaf* obtaining its distinct shape, and proper
posture together; both being perfect, not only in the outer, but Central
and minutest *Leaves*, which are five hundred times smaller than the
outer: both which in the Cautious opening of a *Germen* may be seen.

15. §. Nor is there greater Art in the *Forms*, than in the *Foulds*
or *Postures* of *Leaves*; both answerably varying, as this or that way
they may be most agreeable. Treat. of the *Quincunx*. Of the *Quincuncial* posture, so amply instanc’d
in by the Learned Sir *Thomas Brown*, I shall omit to speak.
Others there are, which though not all so universal, yet equally necessary
where they are, giving two general advantages to the *Leaves*,
*Elegancy* and *Security*, *sc.* in taking up, so as their *Forms* will bear,
the least room; and in being so conveniently couch’d, as to be capable
of receiving protection from other Parts, or of giving it one to another;
as for instance,

16. §. First, There is the *Bow-Lap*, where the *Leaves* are all
laid somewhat convexly one over another, but not plaited; being to
the length, breadth and number of *Leaves* most agreeable; as in the
Buds of *Pear-tree*, *Plum-tree*, &c. But where the *Leaves* are not so
thick set, as to stand in the *Bow-Lap*, there we have the *Plicature*, or
the *Flat-Lap*; as in *Rose-Tree*, *Strawberry*, *Cinquefoyl*, *Burnet*, &c. For
the *Leaves* being here plaited, and so lying in half their breadth, and
divers of them thus also collaterally set together; the thickness of
them all, and half their breadth, are much alike dimensions; by which
they stand more secure within themselves, and in better consort with
other *Germen-Growths* in the same *Truss*. If the *Leaves* be much indented
or jagg’d, now we have the *Duplicature*; wherein there
are divers *Plaits* in one *Leaf*, or *Labels* of a *Leaf*, but in distinct
*Sets*, a lesser under a greater; as in *Souchus*, *Tansey*, &c. When
the *Leaves* stand not collaterally, but single; and are moreover
very broad; then we have the *Multiplicature*; as in *Gooseberries*, *Mallows*,
&c. the *Plaits* being not only divers in the same *Leaf*, but of
the same *Set* continuant, and so each *Leaf* gather’d up in five, seven
or more *Foulds*, in the same manner as our Gentlewomens Fans.
Where either the thickness of the *Leaf* will not permit a *Flat-Lap*, or
the fewness of their number, or the smalness of their *Fibers*, will allow
the *Rowl*, there This may be observed. Which is sometimes single, as in
*Bears-Ears*, *Arum*, *Flammula*, *Jerusalem Cowslip*, &c. Sometimes double,
the two *Rowls* beginning at each edge of the *Leaf*, and meeting
in the middle. Which again, is either the *Fore-Rowl*, or the *Back-Rowl*.
If the *Leaf* be design’d to grow long, now we have the *Back-Rowl*,
as in *Docks*, *Sorrels*, and the rest of this Kindred: as also in
*Primrose*, and other like *Plants*. For the main *Fibers*, and therewith
a considerable part of the *Cortical Body* standing prominent from
the *Back-side* of the *Leaf*, they thus stand securely couch’d up betwixt

the two *Rowls*; on whose security the growth of the *Leaf*
in length depends. But those of *Bears-Ears*, *Violets*, *Doves Foot*,
*Warden*, and many more, upon contrary respects, are rowled up inwards.
Lastly, there is the *Tre-Rowl*, as in *Fern*; the *Labels* whereof,
though all rowled up to the *main Stem*, yet could not stand so
firm and secure from the Injuries either of the *Ground* or *Weather*, unless
to the *Rowls* in breadth, that by the length were super-induc’d;
the *Stalk* or *main Stem* giving the same Protection here, which in
other *Plants* by the *Leaves*, or some particular *Mantling*, is contriv’d.
These, and other *Foulds*, See in the *Figures* belonging to the *First*
**Part** of the *Fourth* **Book**.

17. §. According to the *Form* and *Foulding* of every *Leaf* or
*Germen*, is its Protection order’d; about six ways whereof may be
observ’d; *sc.* by *Leaves*, *Surfoyls*, *Interfoyls*, *Stalks*, *Hoods* and *Mantlings*.
To add to what we have above given, one or two Instances.
Every *Bud*, besides its proper *Leaves*, is covered with divers Leafy
*Pannicles* or *Surfoyls*; which, what the *Leaves* are to one another,
are that to them all: For not opening except gradually, they admit
not the *Weather*, *Wet*, *Sun* or *Aer*, to approach the *Leaves*, except by
degrees respondent, and as they are gradually inur’d to bear them.
Sometimes, besides *Surfoyls*, there are also many *Interfoyls* set betwixt
the *Leaves*, from the Circumference to the Center of the *Bud*; as in
the *Hasel*. For the *Fibres* of these *Leaves* standing out so far from a
plain surface; they would, if not thus shelter’d, lie too much expos’d
and naked to the *Severities* of the *Weather*. Where none of all the
Protections above-named, are convenient, there the *Membranes* of the
*Leaves* by continuation in their first forming (together with some *Fibres*
of the *Lignous Body*) are drawn out into so many *Mantles* or
*Veils*; as in *Docks*, *Snakeweed*, &c. For the *Leaves* here being but
few, yet each *Leaf* and its *Stalk* being both exceeding long; at the
bottom whereof the next following *Leaf* still springs up; the form
and posture of all is such, as supersedes all the other kinds of Protection,
and so each *Leaf* apart is provided with a *Veil* to it self. These,
and other *Protections*, See in the *Figures* belonging to the *First* **Part**
of the *Fourth* **Book**.

18. §. The Uses of the *Leaves*, I mean in respect of their service
to the *Plant* it self, are these: First, for Protection; which, besides
what they give one to another, they afford also to the *Flower*
and *Fruit*. To the *Flower* in their *Foulds*; that being, for the most
part, born and usher’d into the open Aer by the *Leaves*. To the
*Fruit*, when afterwards they are display’d, as in *Strawberries*, *Grapes*,
*Rasps*, *Mulberries*, &c. On which, and the like, should the Sun-Beams
immediately strike, especially while they are young, they
would quite shrivel them up; but being by the *Leaves* screened off,
they impress the circumjacent *Aer* so far only as gently to warm the
said *Fruits*, and so to promote their *Fermentation* and *Growth*. And
accordingly we see, that the *Leaves* above-named are exceeding large
in proportion to the *Fruits*: whereas in *Pear-trees*, *Apple-trees*, &c.
the *Fruit* being of a solider *Parenchyma*, and so not needing the like
protection, are usually equal with, and often wider in Diameter than
the *Leaves*.

19. §. Another use is for Augmentation; or, the capacity for
the due spreading and ampliation of a *Tree* or other *Plant*, are its
*Leaves*. For herein the *Lignous Body* being divided into small *Fibres*,
and these running all along their lax and spongie *Parenchyma*; they
are thus a *Body* fit for the imbibition of *Sap*, and easie *Growth*. Now
the *Sap* having a free reception into the *Leaves*, it still gives way to
the next succeeding in the *Branches* and *Trunk*, and the voyding
of the *Sap* in these, for the mounting of that in the *Root*, and ingress
of that in the *Ground*. But were there no *Leaves* to make a free
reception of *Sap*, it must be needs be stagnant in all the *Parts* to the
*Root*, and so the *Root* being clogg’d, its fermenting and other Offices
will be voyded, and so the due *Growth* of the whole. As in the motion
of a *Watch*, although the original term thereof be the *Spring*, yet,
the capacity for its continuance in a due measure throughout all the
*Wheels*, is the free and easie motion of the *Ballance*.

20. §. Lastly, As the *Leaves* subserve the more copious advancement,
so the higher purity of the *Sap*. For this being well fermented
both in the *Root*, and in its Ascent through the *Trunk*, and
so its *Parts* prepar’d to a farther separation; the grosser ones are
still deposited into the *Leaves*; the more elaborate and essential only
thus supplied to the *Flower*, *Fruit* and *Seed*, as their convenient *Aliment*.
Whence it is, that where the *Flowers* are many and large, into
which the more odorous *Particles* are copiously receiv’d, the green
*Leaves* have little or no smell; as those of *Rose-tree*, *Carnations*, *French-Marigold*,
*Wood-bind*, *Tulips*, &c. But on the contrary, where the
*Flowers* are none, or small, the green *Leaves* themselve are likewise of
a strong savour; as those of *Wormwood*, *Tansie*, *Baum*, *Mint*, *Rue*,
*Geranium Moschatum*, *Angelica*, and others.

### An Appendix.

*Of Thorns, Hairs and Globulets.*

T*Horns* are of two kinds, *Lignous* and *Cortical*. Of the first are
such as those of the *Hawthorn*, and are constituted of all the
same substantial *Parts* whereof the *Germen* or *Bud* it self, and in a
like proportion: which also in their Infancy are set with the resemblances
of divers minute *Leaves*. Of affinity with these are the *Spinets*
or *Thorny Prickles* upon the Edges and Tops of divers *Leaves*, as of
*Barbery*, *Holly*, *Thistle*, *Furze*, and others; all which I think are the
filamentous extremities of the *Lignous Body* sheathed in the *Skin*. But
this principal difference betwixt a *Bud* and these *Lignous Thorns*, is observable;
That the *Bud* hath its Original from the Inner part of the
*Lignous Body*, next the *Pith*: But these *Thorns*, from the outer, and
less fecund Part; and so produceth no *Leaves*, but is, as it were, the
*Mola* of a *Bud*.

2. §. *Cortical Thorns* are such as those of the *Rasberry* Bush, being
not, unless in a most extraordinary small and invisible proportion
propagated from the *Lignous Body*, but as, it seems, wholly from the
*Cortical* and *Skin*, or from the exteriour part of the *Barque*.

3. §. The *Growth* of this *Thorn* may farther argue what in the
*C. 2. §. 25.* *Second Chapter* we supposed;
 *sc.* That as the proper *Tendency* of the
*Lignous Body*, is to *Ascend*; so of the *Cortical* to *Descend*. For as the
*Lignous Thorn*, like other *Parts* of the *Trunk*, in its *Growth* ascends;
This, being almost wholly *Cortical*, pointeth downward. Hist. of the *Prop.* of *Veget.* The use of
*Thorns* the Ingenious Mr. *Sharrock* hath observed.

4. §. Upon the *Leaves* of divers *Plants* two *Productions* shew
themselves, *sc.* *Hairs* and *Gloubulets*. Of *Hairs*, only one kind is
taken notice of; although they are various. Ordinarily they are of
a *Simple Figure*; which when fine and thick set, as on most *Hairy
Buds*; or fine and long, as on those of the *Vine*, we call them *Down*.

5. §. But sometimes they are *Branched out*, from the bottom to the
top, reciprocally on every side, in some resemblance to a *Stags Horn*;
as in *Mullen*. And sometimes they are *Astral*, as upon *Lavender*, and
some other *Leaves*, and especially those of *Wild Olive*; wherein every
*Hair* rising in one round entire *Basis* a little way above the surface of
the *Leaf*, is then disparted, Star-like, into several, four, five or six
*Points*, all standing at right Angles with the said perpendicular *Basts*.

6. §. The Uses of *Hairs* are for *Distinction* and *Protection*. That
of *Distinction* is but secondary, the *Leaves* being grown to a considerable
size. That of *Protection* is the prime, for which they were originally
form’d together with the *Leaves* themselves, and whose service
they enjoy in their Infant-estate: For the *Hairs* being then in form
of a *Down*, always very thick set, thus, give that *Protection* to the
*Leaves*, which their exceeding tenderness then requires; so that they
seem to be veiled with a Coat of *Frize*, or to be kept warm, like
young and dainty *Chickens*, in *Wool*.

7. §. *Globulets* are seen upon *Orach*, both Garden and Wild;
and yet more plainly on *Mercury* or *Bonus Henricus*. In these, growing
almost upon the whole *Plant*, and being very large, they are by
all taken notice of.

8. §. But strict Observation discovers, that these *Globulets* are
the natural and constant Off-spring of very many other *Plants*. Both
these *Globulets*, and likewise the diversity of *Hairs*, I find that Mr.
*Hook* hath also observed. Micrography.I take notice, that they are of two kinds;
*Transparent*, as upon the *Leaves* of *Hysop*, *Mint*, *Baume*, and many more
*White*, as upon those of *Germander*, *Sage*, and others. All which,
though the naked Eye will discover, yet by the help of *Glasses* we
may observe them most distinctly. The use of these we suppose the
same, in part, with those of the *Flower*, whereof we shall speak.
