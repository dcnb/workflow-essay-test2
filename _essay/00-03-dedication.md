## Dedication

TO THE
      

    Right Honourable
      

    WILLIAM
      

    Lord VisCount *BROUNCKER*,
      

    PRESIDENT
      

    OF THE
      

    Royal Society.

MY LORD,

![O](images/i_drop_o_171.jpg)
*NE
Reason why I Dedicate the following*
Discourses *to Your* Lordship, *is, For that by
Your great undeserved Respects, You have
obliged me to do no less.*

*Another, my* Lord, *is, Because I could
not but Publickly return Your* Lordship
*Thanks, for minding the* Royal Society *of so good a Way,
they are lately resolved upon, for the Management of a
great part of their Business. Wherein, my* Lord, *I do more
than presume, that I also speak the Sense of the whole* Society;
*I think, not any one excepted.*

*I may with the same Confidence intimate, my* Lord,
*how happy they account themselves, in having a* Person
*so fit to preside their Affairs, as Your* Lordship. *The
Largeness of your Knowledge, the Exactness of Your Judgment,
the Evenness of Your Comport; being some of those
necessary Qualifications, which His* Majesty *had in His
Eye (as right well understanding what He did) when
He fixed His Choice upon Your* Lordship.

*I know, my* Lord, *that there are some men, who have*

*just so much Understanding, as only to teach them how to
be Ambitious: The Flattering of whom, is somewhat like
the Tickling of Children, till they fall a Dancing. But I
also know, that Your* Lordship *unconcerneth Your self as
much, in what I even now spake; as* Cæsar *did himself,
when his* Souldiers *began to style him* King. *For as he said,*
Non Rex, sed Cæsar: *So let Your* Lordship *be but once
nam’d, and all that follows, is but a* Tautology *to what You
are already known to be. Your being* President *of the* Royal
Society, *Your being the* First *that was Chosen, and* Chosen
*by so Knowing a* Prince; *becomes so real a* Panegyrick *to Your*
Lordship, *as leaveth Verbal ones without any sound.*

*Whence, my* Lord, *I have a third Reason most naturally
emergent, which is, That I dare to submit my self, as to what I
have hereafter said, to Your* Lordships *Censure. You being
so able and just an* Arbiter *betwixt the same and all those Persons
therein concern’d; that You can neither be deceived, nor
corrupted, to make a Judgment in any Point, to the Injury of
either.*

*And truly, my* Lord, *were it only from a Principle of self-Interest,
yet I could not desire it should be otherwise. For the*
World, *if it lives, will certainly grow as much more knowing
than it is; as it is now more, than it was heretofore. So
that we have as little Reason to despise* Antiquity; *as we can
have willingness, that we our selves should be despised by* Posterity.

*Yet some difference there is to be made;* viz. *betwixt those
of all* Ages, *who have been modestly ignorant; and those who
have thought, or pretended, that they were Omniscient. Or
if knowing and acknowledging that they were Ignorant; have
yet not been contented to be so; unless, with as good manners,
as sense, they did conjure all Mankind not to offer at the knowing
any more than themselves.*

*Upon the whole, my* Lord, *I desire not You should be a* Patron,
*any further than You are a* Judge. *For if this small*
Essay *hath deserved the least acceptance, I am sure, that in
being one, You will be both.*

*I am*,

My Lord,

Your *Lordships* most Faithful

and Obedient Servant,

*NEHEMJAH GREW*.

## Lecture on Mixture

A
      

    DISCOURSE
      

    Read before the
      

    ROYAL SOCIETY
      

    *Decemb. 10. 1674.*
      

    Concerning the
      

    *NATURE*, *CAUSES*, and *POWER*
      

    OF
      

    **MIXTURE.**

AVING
 the honour to perform the Task of
this day; I shall endeavour to conform to the
*Phylosophy*, which this *Society* doth profess;
which is, *Reasoning grounded upon Experiment,
and the Common Notions of Sense*. The former
being, without the latter, too subtle and intangible;
the latter without the former, too gross
and unmanageable: but both together, bearing
a true analogy to our selves; who are neither
Angels, nor meer Animals, but Men.

The Subject I have chosen to speak of, is *Mixture*. Whereof, that
our *Discourse* may be the more *consistent*, and the better *intelligible*;
all I have to say, shall be ranged into this Method; *viz.*

1. First, I shall give a brief account of the received *Doctrine* of
*Mixture*.

2. Next, lay down some *Propositions* of the *Principles* whereof all
*Mixed* Bodies consist.

3. Then, open the true *Nature* of *Mixture*; or say, *What* it is.

4. And then enumerate the *Causes* of *Mixture*; or say, *How* it is
made.

5. Lastly, I shall shew the *Power* of *Mixture*; or, *What* it can *do*.
