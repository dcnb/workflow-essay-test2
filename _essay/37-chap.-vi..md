HE
 *Visible Causes* of the *Figures* of *Leaves*, have
been formerly mentioned. *B. 1. Ch. 4.* It may here be
further noted, That the greater *Fibers* of the
*Leaf*, being never Braced in the *Stalk*; it is a
good preparative for their better spreading in
the *Leaf*. As also, that the same is much favour’d,
by the extream smalness of the *Aer-Vessels* herein:
whereby they are more easily divaricated, in
the lesser *Fibers*, and so the *Leaf* dilated.

2. §. BUT these and the like are to be reckoned a secondary *Order*
of *Causes*; which serve rather to carry on and improve, that which
*Nature* hath once begun. *Idea, §. 53.* And therefore, we must not only consider
the visible *Mechanism* of the *Parts*; but also the *Principles* of which
they are composed; wherewith, Nature seems to draw her first
*Strokes*.

3. §. Now of these, I have formerly, and as I conceive upon good
ground, supposed, the chief Governing *Principle*, to be the *Saline*,
whether *Alkaline*, *Acid*, or of any other Kind:
 *Lib. 2. P. 2. §. 31,* &c.
 being in some sort as
the *Mold* of a *Button*, to which the other *Principles*, as its *Attire*, do
all conform. Or the *Salts* are, as it were, the *Bones*; the other *Principles*,
as the *Flesh* which covers them.

4. §. A further Argument hereof may be deduced from the *Cuticular*
and other *Concretions*, commonly called *Mothers*, in Distill’d *Waters*,
*Vinegar*, and other *Liquors*. For in these *Concretions*, there is always
a tendence to *Vegetation*; and many of them are true *Vegetables*
in their Kind; as shall hereafter be seen. Now the *Liquors*, in which
these are generated, do always, wholly or in part, lose their *Tast* and
*Smell*, and so become *Vapid*. The more sensible *Principles* therein
having made their *Transit* from the *Fluid*, into the *Concrete Parts*. So,
I have known, sometimes, *Vinegar* it self, to become by these *Concretions*,
almost as *Tastless* as Common *Water*. Whereby it seems evident,
That of *Vegetable Principles*, there are some, more Masterly than others:
and that of these, the *Saline* is the chief. The same is likewise argued,
from the frequent Experiment of many good Husband-men; that most
*Bodies* which abound with *Salt*, are the greatest *Nourishers* of *Plants*.

5. §. This *Saline Principle*, as is above hinted, is to be understood,
a *Generik* Name, under which divers *Species* are comprehended;
and of some whereof, it is always compounded, as in other *Bodies*,
so in *Plants*. As shall be made to appear, by divers Experiments, when
we come, hereafter, to speak of *Vegetable Salts*. Whereby we are conducted,
yet further to enquire, What are the *Principles* of this *Principle*?

6. §. NOW these seem to be Four; a *Nitrous*, an *Acid*, an *Alkaline*,
and a *Marine*. The *Admixture* of the First, is argu’d from the
Place, which Nature hath assigned for the *Generation* and *Growth* of
most *Plants*, *sc.* neither in *Caverns* under Ground, as for *Minerals*; nor
above it, as for *Animals*; but the Surface of the Earth, where this
Sort of *Salt* is copiously bred. And doth therefore prove, not only a
*Mixture*, but a good Proportion hereof with the other *Principles* of a
*Plant*. Hence it is, that *Dew* or *Water* on *Windows* or Plain and Smooth
*Tables*, by virtue of a *Nitro-Aerial Salt*, is often frozen into the resemblance
of little *Shrubs*. And the like *Figure* I have often seen in a well
filtred *Solution* of the *Salt* of any of our *Purging Waters*, as of *Epsom*,
&c. being set to *shoot*. Produced, as I conceive, by the *Nitre*, which
with the *Rain* or other *Waters*, is washed down from the *Surface* of the
*Earth*, and so mixed with the *Mineral Salts*.

7. §. The other Three *Salts* are exhibited, by the several ways of
Resolving the *Principles* of a *Plant*. Many *Plants*, even in their *Natural
Estate*, do yield an *Acid Juyce*. And the *Juyces* of many more, by *Fermentation*,
will become *Acid*. And most, by *Distillation* in a *Sand-Furnace*,
yield an *Acid Liquor*.

8. §. By *Calcination*, all Sorts of *Plants*, yield more or less, both of
a *Fixed* and a *Volatile Alkaly*: the former, in the *Ashes*; the latter, in the
*Soot*. And, at least the generality, by *Fermentation* also, yield a *Volatile*
one; or such a kind of *Salt*, which, whether we call an *Urinous*, or
otherwise, hath the like *Odour* and *Tast* with that of *Urine*, *Harts-Horn*,
*Soot*, and the like.

9. §. The *Marine*, is obtained no other way, that I know of, but
from a Solution of the *Alkaline*, upon its being exposed to the *Aer*.
The process wherof, I shall particularly set down in a following *Discourse*.
Of these *Salts*, mixed in a certain proportion, together, and
also Impregnated with some of the other *Active Principles* of a *Plant*,
and not without an *Admixture* of some *Parts* from the *Aer*; I suppose,
that which I call the *Essential*, is produced: of which, I shall also give
an account in the same *Discourse*.

10. §. ALL THE Four *Salts* above mentioned, seem in their *Order*,
to have a share in the *Formation* of a *Leaf*, or other *Part* of a *Plant*:
And first of all, the *Marine*. For all *Generations* are made in some
*Fluid*: But in every *Fluid* there is a perpetual *Intestive Motion* of
*Parts*. So that the first Intention of *Nature* is, That some of those
*Parts* be disposed to *Rest*. Now of all the *Principles* of a *Plant*, there
are none hereunto more disposed, than their *Salts*; whose *Particles*,
being figu’rd with plain Sides, as often as they touch Side to Side, like
two *Marbles* exquisitely polished, they will adhere together. And the
*Particles* of *Marine Salt*, being *Cubick*; and so, with respect to their *Figure*,
of greater *Bulk* than those of any other *Salt*; they will hereby, be
most and first of all disposed to *Rest*; and so become, as it were, the
Foundation of the following *Superstructure*.

11. §. THE Second Intention of Nature is, That the *Particles* be
brought to *Rest*, in a certain *Position*, agreeable to the *Figure* of the
*Parts* which are to be formed. And therefore in the next place, all
those *Parts* of a *Plant* which are truly *Lignous*, by the *Marine Salt*,
with the assistance of the *Alkaline*, but especially of the *Nitrous*, are
made to shoot out in Length, or into an innumerable company of small
*Cylindrick Fibres*: *Tab. 53.* these *Salts* being, altogether, sturdy enough to resist
those *Impulses* which might incline them to conform to any other *Figure*.

12. §. THE next Intention is, That these *Fibres*, at the same time
in which they are formed, may likewise receive such a *Posture* as will
best answer the indented *Shape* of the *Leaf*. Which *Posture*, although
in the *Growth* of the *Leaf* it is much Govern’d by the *Aer-Vessels*; yet
in the *Generation* hereof, seems to be first determined by the forementioned
*Salts*, according to their several *Angles*, whereby they are differently
applicable one to another.

13. §. Now all the *Sides* of the *Marine Salt*, and the *Sides* and the
*Ends* of the *Nitrous*, properly so called, stand at *Right Angles*. And
it is very probable, from the *Figure* of the *Crystalls* in *Spirit* of *Blood*,
and some other *Bodies*, that the *Particles* of the *Alkaline* are Square at
one End, and Poynted at the other. *Tab. 53.* And those of the *Acid*, at both;
And that, withal, they are Shorter and more Slender.

14. §. It should therefore seem, That where the *Alkaline Salt* is
any way predominant, and that the *Particles* thereof are placed End to
End; there the *Lignous Fibres* (as the larger ones in many *Leaves*) *Tab. 53.*
declining their parallel *Growth*, begin to shoot out obliquely, or at *Angles*
one with another, and those *Acute*.

15. §. If the same *Salt* be predominant, and some of its *Particles*
placed, with the Pointed End of one, to the Side of another, *Tab. 53.* or the
Square End of one, to the Poynted End of another; there the said *Fibres*
begin to shoot at *Angles* less *Acute*.

16. §. But if either the *Marine* or *Nitrous Salt* is predominant; or
some *Particles* of the *Alkaline*, are placed with the Square End of one,
to the Side of another; *Tab. 53.* there the *Fibres* begin to make, not *Acute*, but
*Right Angles*; as do the greater *Fibres*, in some *Leaves*; and the smaller,
in all.

17. §. IN the same manner, the *Fibre* in the Circumference of
the *Leaf* is also governed; the *Particles* of the said *Salt*, being reduceable,
not only to any *Angle*, but also to any *Circle*, or other *Crooked
Line*, as they are variously applyed. For if the *major part* be applied
End to End, and only every Third or Fourth applied End to Side, they
produce a great *Circle*. *Tab. 53.* But if the Poynted End of each, be set to the
Side of another, they make a less. And if the Application be the same,
but to the contrary Side, they thence begin a new *Circle* with the
same *Diameter*, but with another *Center*, answerable to the intended
*Shape* of the *Leaf*.

18. §. AFTER the same manner, the *Aer-Vessels* may be formed by
the *Particles* of the *Acid Salt*. Which, without being supposed to be
crooked (as those of the *Aer*, at least the compounded ones, probably
be) only by applying the lesser Side of one, to the greater Side of
another, will also be reduced to any either *Circular* or *Spiral Line*.
*Tab. 53.* And so, likewise, for the production of the winding *Fibres*, which compose
the *Bladders* of the *Pith* and other *Parenchymous Parts* of a *Plant*.

19. §. Thus doth *Nature* every where γεωμετρεῖν. For what She appears
in Her *Works*, She must needs be also in their *Causes*.
